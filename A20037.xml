            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE impugnations which the enemie of the whole Church ſo ſtrangely &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly maketh againſt this Church of <hi>England,</hi> are not ſo much to be marueiled at, as of euery true Christian heart to be lamented. They of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> condemne vs, for falling away ſo farre from them: ſuch as are ſprong vp amongeſt our ſelues, and are gone out from vs, becauſe wee approch ſo neere vnto them. The firſt hold vs as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian,</hi> for ſhaking off the Popes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, whome they make Chriſtes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car: the others, for that wee retaine (they ſay) his gouernment ſtill, &amp; are in bondage to it. The firſt ſay, we are out of the true
<pb facs="tcp:18839:3"/>Church: the others ſay no leſſe, and that we haue not Gods Church amongſt vs. The firſt affirme, that we haue no Miniſters, no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, no lawful ſeruice of God amongſt vs: the others, that we haue no Miniſters rightly called, no ſacraments duely admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, no worſhip of God, and that we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a falſe Chriſt. The firſt holde, that the ſeruice of God in our Churches is ſo wicked, as it is not to bee frequented: the others, that it is idolatrous, and to be auoided. The firſt are of opinion, that the Soueraigne <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Magiſtrate ought not to haue gouernment in cauſes Eccleſiastical, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then to defend the Church, and to ſee the lawes therof executed, becauſe making of Church lawes and gouernment Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, is ſoly in the Pope, and in his Clergy: the others holde the like poſition againſt the Princes Eccleſiaſticall ſupremacie, for that this gouernment belongeth to Elderſhips and Synodes of Miniſters and Elders, (for elſe Chriſt doth not gouerne in his Church) as they teach.

<pb facs="tcp:18839:3"/>yet to one and the ſelfe ſame end, which is, the vtter ouerthrowe of the Church, if their courſes be not carefully and ſpeedily preuented. Which (me thinketh) may best be effected by <hi>doctrine</hi> and by <hi>diſcipline.</hi> The first by inſtructing the ſimple ſeduced, and by confuting mightily the froward and inſolent: the ſecond, by ſharper corroſiues against the wilfull and obstinate ſect-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters on both ſides, being <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>WO things eſpecially are ſette foorth in this whole booke of the Reuelation. Firſt, the perſecutions and the rewardes of thoſe that with true faith cleaue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Chriſt: ſecondly, the aſſaults and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked attempts of the enemies of the trueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church, together with their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and ouerthrowe. Becauſe it is a propheſie of thinges to come, therfore is the booke hard to be vnderſtood: for propheſies ſooner are fulfilled in the worlde, then the world can perceaue the true expoſition and interpretation of them. This verſe doeth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter occaſion to ſpeake both of the wicked, which do perſecute, and of the godly which are perſecuted; and it hath ſome thinges in it eaſie, and ſome harde to bee vnderſtoode. Who the <hi>beaſt</hi> is, and who be theſe <hi>kings,</hi> and what be their <hi>armies,</hi> and what is the maner of their fight, we knowe: and who it is that <hi>rideth on the horſe,</hi> and what is his armie, wee may with ſmal ſearching eaſily finde out, for time hath reueiled theſe things. But the time
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18839:5"/>wherein this laſt fight of the beaſt ſhall bee, and the maner how he ſhal be ouerthrowen, hath ſome doubt. I wil ſpeake of theſe things in order, as they lie in the text.</p>
            <p>The beaſt here ſpoken of, is the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> the <hi>Kings of the earth</hi> meant in this place, are the princes that ſubmit themſelues to the obedience of him: their <hi>armies</hi> are both the captaines and warlike ſouldiers, and alſo the manifolde and ſundry ſortes of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clefiaſticall and ſpirituall perſons, as they call them, which either by force of armes, or by witte and eloquence, by ſtrength or pollicie fight for him. Hee that <hi>rideth on the horſe</hi> is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> his <hi>armie</hi> are they that beleeue in him onely for ſaluation, and obey his Goſpell. In ſpeaking of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and his <hi>armies,</hi> and their <hi>fighting,</hi> I muſt ſtriue to bee the more briefe, not onely becauſe the matter of it ſelfe is large, and ſuch as whereof a man can finde no end, if he would go about to ſpeake all that may be ſaid, but alſo becauſe (I feare) it would be ſomewhat tedious vnto you, to heare me ſpeake of that whereof you haue heard others ſpeake very oft, and largely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Of the other part, that is, of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>armie,</hi> it is comfortable and profitable for vs to heare, becauſe wee doe account our ſelues which doe profeſſe the Goſpell in this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18839:5"/>land, to be as it were a wing, or an olde trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned band of that armie. I thought it neceſſary to ſpeake of theſe two pointes at this time. Firſt, becauſe <hi>Antichriſt</hi> either now renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or continueth ſtill his warre againſt vs, or at leaſt is ſuſpected, and of ſome reported ſo to doe. Secondly, becauſe among our ſelues, there are that blaſpheme the hoſte of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, and ſay that wee are not the <hi>armie of Chriſt.</hi> And albeit that it were out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that we are <hi>Chriſtes armie,</hi> yet we ſee in all places, that there is a mutinie in this <hi>armie,</hi> and it is neceſſarie if we will obtaine the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, that we muſt be an vnited armie. Thus I haue ſet before you, the matter that I muſt ſpeake of, and the cauſes that mooued me to it. Nowe therefore I will firſt intreate of the <hi>beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>beaſt</hi> in this place is ſet for one of the greateſt enemies of <hi>Ieſus Christ</hi> vpon earth, which is the generall and chiefe captaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer kings and their armies in the fielde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The deuill is doubtleſſe the chiefe leader of all that fight againſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. But he in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> is not called the <hi>beaſt,</hi> but by other names: for he is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>olde ſerpent,</hi> and <hi>ſatan.</hi> The deuill is not the <hi>beaſt,</hi> but <hi>giueth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the beaſt:</hi> the <hi>beaſt</hi> is not the <hi>dragon,</hi> but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18839:6"/>
               <hi>ſpeaketh like the dragon.</hi> The <hi>beaſt</hi> is a viſible earthly power raiſed vp by the diuell, that <hi>hath authoritie ouer kings.</hi> To know him is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to ouercome him: for fewe are hurt by him, but ſuch as knowe him not. This <hi>beaſt</hi> (as I ſaid) is the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Papiſtes, as they reſiſt other poſitions that we holde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, ſo aboue all others, they muſt needes ſtand againſt this. They will not haue the Pope to be the <hi>beaſt,</hi> for they knowe that this <hi>beaſt</hi> is <hi>Antichrist.</hi> And what is <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> but the capitall enemie to <hi>Ieſus Chriſt?</hi> Wherefore they ſee, that if the Pope be the <hi>beaſt,</hi> then all reuerence and obedience to him, muſt of neceſſitie be forſaken. Nowe therefore I will ſhewe, that all things which are ſpoken in Scripture of this <hi>beaſt</hi> &amp; <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> agree moſt fitly to the popedome, and not to any other earthly power.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Beast</hi> that is ſpoken of heere, is the ſame that is mentioned, <hi>Apoc. 13.11.</hi> which was the <hi>ſecond beaſt</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſawe, <hi>which came vp out of the earth, and had two hornes like the Lambe, but ſpake like the Dragon:</hi> &amp; it is the ſame <hi>beast,</hi> which whoſoeuer <hi>worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth,</hi> or <hi>his image,</hi> or <hi>receiueth his marke, hee must drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. 14.9.</hi> and it is that <hi>beast which ſendeth out of his mouth, three vncleane ſpirites like
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18839:6"/>frogs, to gather the kings to the battell</hi> here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>Apoc. 16.13.</hi> It is that <hi>ſcarlet colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red beaſt full of names of blaſphemie, which hath ſeuen heads and ten hornes. Apoc. 17.3.</hi> of the ſame <hi>beast</hi> mentioned ſo before, it is ſaid here: <hi>I ſawe the beaſt and the kings of the earth and their armies, gathered together to fight againſt him that ſate vpon the horſe, and againſt his armie.</hi> This <hi>beaſt</hi> both in the <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and in other partes of Scripture hath diuers other names: for it is named the <hi>great whore that ſitteth vpon many waters, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. 17.1. The woman araied in purple and ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and gilded with gold and precious ſtones and pearles, Apoc. 17.4.</hi> and it is called <hi>Babylon the great citie, Apoc. 18.2.</hi> That which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> and <hi>of the man of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>the ſonne of perdition,</hi> whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>an aduerſarie, 2. Theſ. 2.3.</hi> is vnderſtood of this <hi>beaſt.</hi> But the moſt vſuall and familiar name, that all eccleſiaſticall writers do giue to this moſt famous enemie of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Church, is that which <hi>Iohn</hi> vſeth when hee ſaieth: <hi>Babes, it is the laſt time, and as ye haue heard that Antichriſt ſhall come, euen now are there many Antichriſts: whereby wee knowe that it is the last tyme, 1. Iohn 2.18.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Euery ſpirite which confeſſeth not, that Ieſus Christ is come in the fleſh, is not of God:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18839:7"/>but this is the ſpirite of Antichrist, of whom yee haue heard how that hee ſhould come, and now alreadie hee is in the world.</hi> This principall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie of <hi>Christ</hi> that maketh warre here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, named <hi>an aduerſarie, the man of ſinne, the ſonne of perdition,</hi> called <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>great whore Antichriſt,</hi> and <hi>the ſecond beaſt,</hi> is the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> with his popiſh gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The deuill as hee laboured that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould not bee knowen when he was in the world, and wrought mans ſaluation by his death: ſo likewiſe he doeth what he may to hide <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that he may worke deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſoules, and yet not be ſuſpected to doe it. That the Papacie may not bee called the kingdome of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the papiſts obtrude to the world a certaine imagined <hi>Antichrist,</hi> ſuch a <hi>beaſt</hi> as neuer was, nor euer ſhall bee: for they ſay <hi>Antichrist</hi> muſt be one particular man, borne of the tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> which ſhall haue his ſeate in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in the <hi>temple there,</hi> and ſhall ſubdue three kings firſt, namely, of <hi>Egypt, Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Libya,</hi> and then other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and ſhall raigne three yeeres &amp; a halfe, neither more nor leſſe, and ſhall be honoured of the Iewes as their <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and ſhall be circumciſed, and ſhall aboliſh bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and the Maſſe, and ſhall ſet vp his own
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18839:7"/>image in the temple, and cauſe the world to worſhip it, and he will deny <hi>Ieſus</hi> to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and cauſe himſelf to be honoured <hi>as God,</hi> and ſo be called, and that hee ſhall giue a marke and ſet it on mens foreheads, or on their right hands, the print of it ſhal be his name, and the letters of his name ſhall make the number of 666. And that hee may mooue men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him the rather, he ſhall doe many myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and eſpecially ſhall faine himſelfe to die and riſe againe from the dead, and cauſe fire to come downe from heauen in the ſight of men: that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ſhal come in their owne perſons and propheſie againſt him, that <hi>Christ</hi> at the ende of three yeeres and a halfe, ſhall ouercome him &amp; put him downe, and that at the end of fourtie dayes after ſhal be the generall iudgement. And before this <hi>Antichriſt</hi> can come, they ſay that the goſpel muſt be receiued publikely of all kingdomes and people in the world: &amp; that the empire of <hi>Rome</hi> which now the <hi>Germanes</hi> hold, muſt cleane both in name and ſubſtance be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for that is a great let vnto him: for while that ſtandeth, he cannot come at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the papiſts worſhipfull <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> a perilous beaſt that ſhall raigne but three yeeres and a halfe. By this notion of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> deepely printed in their heads, their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18839:8"/>minds are turned away from ſeeing the Pope to bee the very beaſtly <hi>Antichriſt</hi> as hee is. They nouriſh the beaſt in their owne boſom, and let him ſucke of their breaſts, or rather ſucke themſelues poiſon out of that <hi>Whores</hi> breaſts, while they imagine that hee ſhall come, they know not when, to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in another ſhape.</p>
            <p>What ſhould make them thinke that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> is one ſingular perſon? The <hi>firſt beaſt,</hi> they and all men confeſſe, is the ſtate and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, &amp; perſecuted the Goſpell openly: that was not one perſon, but many perſons, one after another, holding vp the ſame eſtate. The <hi>ſecond beast</hi> reuiueth the image of the firſt, in the ſame citie: therefore the ſecond is not one perſon, but a ſucceſſion of many, which renew, as it were, the olde honour and ſtate of <hi>Rome.</hi> This doth the order of Popes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one another. And although (as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> anſwereth) one beaſt in Daniel is ſet for one man, as the <hi>Leopard</hi> for <hi>Alexander magnus,</hi> yet there alſo the <hi>Lion</hi> repreſenteth the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and the <hi>Beare</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: ſo heere in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> as the <hi>firſt beaſt</hi> is ſet for the heathen empire, ſo the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond beast</hi> is ſet for the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> papacie of <hi>Rome. Augustine</hi> thinketh that this <hi>beaſt</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:18839:8"/>muſt not be vnderſtood for one man, but for one city. <hi>Quae ſit porro iſta beſtia, &amp;c. What this beast is, it is not repugnant to right faith, that the very wicked citie be vnderstood, as the people of vnbeleeuers, contrarie to the beleeuing people and citie of God.</hi> The beaſt then, by <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> opinion, is a citie, a multitude, not one ſingular perſon. If we ſhall marke that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith concerning the beginning and end of <hi>Antichriſt, the myſterie of iniquitie alreadie worketh,</hi> and that <hi>the Lord ſhall aboliſh him with the brightneſſe of his comming:</hi> and that which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ye haue heard that Antichriſt ſhould come, and now alreadie he is in the world,</hi> wee ſhall ſee that <hi>the Antichriſt</hi> can not be one man, the foundation of whoſe kingdome was laid ſo long before, and the end whereof ſhall not come till the end of all: for is it not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, that there ſhould be ſo ancient a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for ſo late and ſo ſhort a reigne of one man? This alſo is moſt euident, that thoſe things which muſt be done of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> can not be performed of one man, no not in his whole life, much leſſe in three yeeres and a halfe. He muſt reſtore the glorie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane empire, he muſt doe all that the other beaſt did before him, he muſt worke many ſignes and miracles, he muſt cauſe the former beaſt to be worſhipped, he muſt ſend foorth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18839:9"/>lying ſpirits to ſeduce them that dwell on the earth, he muſt kill them that worſhip not the image of the beaſt, and receiue not his marke: nay thoſe things that they grant <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> ſhall do, can not be done in that ſpace. He muſt winne <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and build the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ouercome all the world, &amp; propound himſelfe to be worſhipped thorow the world, and take away baptiſme in all the world, and doe many other things. Can theſe things be done in three yeeres and a halfe? or while he doth theſe things, ſhall he not be their <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt?</hi> But they ſay <hi>Paul</hi> calleth him <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>Iohn, the Antichriſt,</hi> adding the Greeke article. That is done for difference, and not for ſingularitie of perſon. No maruell if a common name of the man of <hi>the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> ſignifie many, ſeeing a proper name ſhall ſignifie a multitude. <hi>Iſrael</hi> firſt a proper name of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and yet ſignifieth all Gods people: <hi>Sion</hi> the proper name of a hill, and yet ſignifieth all the church of God. The <hi>beaſt</hi> is <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>the Antichriſt,</hi> becauſe of all <hi>Antichriſts</hi> (for there are many, euen ſo many as there are hereſies againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>) he is the greateſt, and cruelleſt, and mightieſt <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> becauſe of all ſinfull men he is cauſe, by his power &amp; lawes, of greateſt &amp; moſt ſinne committed in Gods
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18839:9"/>church. Laſt of all (they ſay) that as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is one perſon, ſo <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> his chiefe enemie, muſt be one perſon: as he that ſitteth on the horſe, that is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is one perſon, ſo <hi>the beast,</hi> that is captaine of thoſe againſt him, muſt be one perſon. The compariſon holdeth not: firſt, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> abideth for euer, therefore on that ſide there is one perſon captaine: but on the other ſide, to fight againſt him, for the ſhort continuance of the perſons, &amp; the long continuance of the fight, there muſt be many perſons, in ſucceſſion, captaines. Secondly, becauſe the fight is not againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his perſon, but in his doctrine, and in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, both which are continued by ſucceſſion, and ſo are the captaines and the warre againſt them. I need not fight ſo long with a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, to deſtroy this opinion of theirs, that <hi>the beaſt</hi> and <hi>the Antichriſt</hi> ſpoken of in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not one ſingular perſon, but a line and ſucceſſion of many that holde and mainteine a gouernement that deſtroyeth the faith and benefites of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus we ſee how vaine one eſpeciall ground of their fained <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is, namely, that he muſt be one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular perſon.</p>
            <p>Another ground of their error is, that this <hi>beaſt</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt be an open enemie of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both in deede and word, in trueth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18839:10"/>and in ſhewe. for they ſay he muſt deny <hi>Ieſus</hi> to be <hi>Chriſt</hi> in plaine termes, and in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deny that he is come: that he muſt take away the ſacraments of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſubſtitute others himſelfe: that he muſt make himſelfe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo be receaued of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and that he muſt by all meanes be without the Church. The Pope (they ſay) is not ſuch a one. He acknowledgeth <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be come, and himſelfe his ſubſtitute and ſeruant, and by our owne confeſſion is after a ſort in the Church. But we holde, and the trueth is, that this <hi>beast</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is a ſecrete enemie cloked with the name of a friend: an aſſe that hath put on a Lions skinne, and that in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie eſpecially; <hi>Satan</hi> changeth himſelfe into an <hi>Angell of light.</hi> If <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhould come like an open profeſſed enemie, all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would eaſily deteſt him, the elect ſhould neuer be in daunger by him: but hee ſhall come ſo cunningly, that hee ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, <hi>if it were poſſible, euen the elect.</hi> And the name of a <hi>mysterie,</hi> Reuel. 17. declareth that his working is ſecrete. and the ſame hath <hi>Paul, the myſterie of iniquitie already worketh.</hi> Wherefore if the kingdome and rule of the <hi>beaſt</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> be a <hi>myſterie,</hi> then is hee a ſecret and not an open profeſſed enemie. And whether doe theſe names of ſeducing, of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18839:10"/>with all deceiueableneſſe of vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and of <hi>ſtrong deluſion to beleeue lies,</hi> (all which are ſpoken of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>) agree rather to a counterfet or an open enemie? The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would haue his people take heed of in the laſt time, is eſpecially the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet friend. <hi>They ſhall ſay, Loe, here is Christ, or there is Chriſt, there ſhall ariſe falſe Christs and falſe prophets.</hi> And to the <hi>Iewes</hi> he ſaith, <hi>If another ſhall come in my name, him will yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</hi> Vpon theſe words they ground that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of theirs, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall receiue <hi>Antichriſt</hi> when he commeth, which ſhall denie the firſt and true <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſet himſelfe to be their <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But that ſaying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour was fulfilled after his aſcenſion, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers that came vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as deliuerers, whom they followed to their deſtruction. But as for the <hi>Iewes</hi> towards the end of the world, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Papiſts ſay their <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall bee, the <hi>Iewes</hi> before that ſhall be conuerted vnto <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth <hi>Rom. 11.</hi> and the popiſh imagined <hi>Antichrist,</hi> of all others, can neuer be receiued of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> for they looke for a <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come of the tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi> and not of the tribe of <hi>Dan:</hi> and they ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt an image, that they can neuer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him their <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that contrary to their law ſhall ſet vp an image to be worſhipped.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18839:11"/>But as I ſayd, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall put vpon him the vizard and face of a friend, and ſhall haue the heart and works of an enemy: for as he is and hath ioined to him as his aſſiſtant the falſe prophet, ſo likewiſe he will tread in the path of falſe prophets. <hi>Beware of falſe prophets</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>for they come in ſheepes clothing, but inwardly they are rauening wolues.</hi> If that be true that ſome do ſay, that in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20. <hi>Gog</hi> is ſet for <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</hi> for the <hi>Turke,</hi> which both ſhould ſucceed and deuide the <hi>Romane</hi> empire, then not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is manifeſt, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is a ſecret enemie, but that hee ſhould haue the Weſt part of the Empire, and the <hi>Turke</hi> the Eaſt: and that wee neede not feare the <hi>Turke</hi> in theſe quarters of the world, nor fauour the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (as ſome doe ſeeme to wiſh in that behalfe) becauſe they thinke they be a wall betweene the <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Chriſtendome.</hi> But God hath ſet the bounds. To the <hi>Turke,</hi> that is, to <hi>Magog</hi> and <hi>Meſek,</hi> which is <hi>Arabia,</hi> where <hi>Mahomets</hi> tombe is, the Eaſt is alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. To <hi>Gog,</hi> that is, the Pope, and <hi>Tubal</hi> with him, which ſome ſay is <hi>Italie,</hi> and others ſay is <hi>Spaine,</hi> to this <hi>Gog</hi> the Weſt part of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which hath hitherto reteined the name of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion, is aſſigned. All the world deſerued to be in bondage vnder enemies of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18839:11"/>the trueth: but the Eaſt is vnder the bodily bondage of the <hi>Turke,</hi> and the Weſt vnder the ſpirituall ſeruitude of the Pope. Now <hi>Magog</hi> which is ſet for the <hi>Turke,</hi> ſignifieth vncouered, open, and manifeſt: but <hi>Gog</hi> ſet for the Pope, ſignifieth couered, ſecret, and hidden: wherefore as the one is an open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ſo the other is ſecret, and therfore more dangerous. If by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> be meant theſe two, then the names do ſhew the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: but I know ſome take thoſe names o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: and ſome confeſſe they know not what they meane. But if that <hi>Gog</hi> do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <hi>Antichrist</hi> to be a ſecret enemie, yet by this it ſhall moſt eaſily appeare, for that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of him, he ſhal ſit in the Temple of God, that is to ſay, he ſhall rule and gouerne in the church of God, as he himſelfe will call it, and as it hath commonly beene reputed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he ſhall gouerne in the church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he muſt ſhew himſelfe to be a friend to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and to the church, or els he can by no meanes deceiue the church of Chriſt. To the woman, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 17. there is giuen a cup of golde, which is vnderſtood to be the ſhew of religion, and yet it is full of abominations. But what need we moe proofes to ſhew that this <hi>beaſt</hi> is a fained and a counterfet friend? <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>The beaſt hath two hornes like the lambe, and yet
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18839:12"/>ſpeaketh like the dragon:</hi> he ſhall make a ſhew of Chriſtian religion, ſhall haue ſpirituall and temporall gouernment, and ſhall faine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be like <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but his lawes and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhalbe the doctrine of deuils. All theſe things prooue that <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which is this <hi>beaſt,</hi> is a ſecret enemy, making ſhew &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a friend.</p>
            <p>If I ſhoulde ſay no more, by this that I haue ſpoken it may ſufficiently be gathered, that this <hi>beast,</hi> this <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> For who is there in the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> of long continuance and great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that ſeemeth more a friend to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and is in trueth ſo ſore an enemie to all that truely beleeue in <hi>Christ,</hi> as is the Pope? But if wee ſearch further, we ſhall ſee that whatſoeuer the Scripture ſpeaketh of this <hi>Enemy,</hi> agreeth fitly to the Pope, and to none other, neither to him, who they imagine ſhall come of the tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> nor to the <hi>Turke,</hi> which is by all meanes out of the church. This title of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ignominie and ſhame, falleth vpon no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in the world, but only on the popedome. All things agree to it.</p>
            <p>The forerunner of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was the fall of the <hi>Romane</hi> empire, and deſtruction of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Weſt: that is it (in the opinion of many ancient fathers) which <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18839:12"/>when he ſayth, <hi>Ye know what withholdeth that he might be reueiled in his time.</hi> And againe, <hi>Onely he which now withholdeth, ſhall let till he be taken out of the way.</hi> The ſeat of the empire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding at <hi>Rome,</hi> withheld the Pope from his reigne &amp; dominion there. But how was that remooued, that the Pope might come into it emptie? Firſt by <hi>Conſtantinus magnus</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thence, &amp; making the ſeat of his empire at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, becauſe it was not yet empty enough, <hi>Alaricus</hi> king of <hi>Goths</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it <hi>anno 414. Genſericus Vandalus</hi> takes it &amp; ſpoiles it againe <hi>an. 459.</hi> And laſt of all, <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilas</hi> taketh it thriſe, ouerthroweth the walles, and ſetteth <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, and letteth it burne 40 dayes, <hi>an. 549.</hi> Thus was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>: <hi>Rome</hi> was made emptie of the emperour, that the Pope might ſtep into it. This is the head that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaw wounded to death. Here the heathen <hi>Romans</hi> that had killed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſword, were killed by the ſword. Although this be ſo, yet the Papiſts contend, that this is not yet fulfilled. The <hi>Romane</hi> empire (ſay they) is not yet diſplaced. Theſe be notable cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning men: that which was done 1000 yeres ſince, is not yet done with them. By this we may iudge of their religion. For as the <hi>Romane</hi> empire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth yet, ſo the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto this time, &amp; no otherwiſe:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18839:13"/>but that empire remaineth onely in name and not in truth: ſo doth the religion. For is that the emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom the Pope by a law hath bound not to dwell in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor in all <hi>Italie,</hi> at any time? Is he emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> that hath no tribute, no homage, nor lands of the empire, and vnleſſe he haue ſomewhat to liue by of his owne, ſhall be nothing inriched by the empire? But (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) he is emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> although he haue not <hi>Rome.</hi> How can he be emperour of it, that hath it neither in poſſeſſion, nor by right of title? if he haue right to it, then the Pope is an vſurper, that keepes him from it: for there is no officer in <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Popes deputy by his appointment. Wherefore the firſt note of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> agreeth to the Pope, which is, that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be made a ruine before he ſhuld come to build vpon it: for that was fulfilled fiue hundred and fiftie yeeres after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſixe hundred yeeres were expired before the papacie did ſhew it ſelfe in his <hi>antichristian</hi> colours.</p>
            <p>The ſecond note of the <hi>beaſt</hi> agreeth alſo to the Pope: for <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith: <hi>He commeth out of the earth, &amp; hath two hornes like the lambe, and ſpeaketh like the dragon. Antichriſt</hi> ſhould in ſhew make himſelfe like <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and performe the works of the deuill. He will write him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

               <hi>Seruus ſeruorum:</hi> and in ſome ſence, ſo he is: for he ſerueth the luſt of thoſe that are ſeruants and ſlaues, to inrich them and bring them to honour. He hath not the hornes of the lambe, but like them: for he challengeth to himſelfe power in temporall and in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall matters: he maketh himſelfe not onely a prieſt, but a king alſo: he will rule in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and in earth. If theſe be not the two hornes of the lambe, what are they? howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is, he will be like the lambe, eſpecially in the hornes. He would reſemble <hi>Christ</hi> in his power, but not in his holineſſe. And to expreſſe his power, he delighteth much with the number of two, for he hath on his head a miter which hath two toppes, two ſharpe points, one before, and another behinde: two keyes alſo hee hath ſet a croſſe. And in the yeere 1300, <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, in the firſt <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> the firſt day went in his biſhops robes, the ſecond day in the habite of the emperour, hauing two ſwords borne before him, &amp; this being proclamed, <hi>Ecce duo gladij hîc.</hi> How can he declare more plainely, that he beareth two hornes like the lambe? whoſe title in the world commeth ſo neere the title of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> for he will be called <hi>Chriſts</hi> vicar. Of the two hornes, he had the ſpirituall iuriſdiction firſt, and then the temporall: for firſt he ruled ouer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18839:14"/>biſhops and miniſters only, and in proceſſe of time he ruled ouer kings and emperours: but although he <hi>haue hornes like the lambe, yet his ſpeech is like the dragons.</hi> The crying of the <hi>dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> is fierce and terrible: and the ſpirituall <hi>dragon,</hi> the deuill, ſpeaketh contrary to God. For the religion of the Pope, is in name <hi>Chriſts</hi> religion, but in truth contrary to it. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith to the people, <hi>Search the Scriptures:</hi> the Pope ſaith they ſhall not reade them. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſerue God onely:</hi> the Pope ſaith, Thou ſhalt ſerue ſaints. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make nor worſhip images:</hi> the Pope ſaith, thou ſhalt do both: and in many points beſides (<hi>Heſſhuſius</hi> reckoneth vp ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) the Pope <hi>ſpeaketh</hi> contrarie to <hi>Christ,</hi> and altogether <hi>like the dragon.</hi> The Papiſts ſay this note can not agree to the Pope. Why? not becauſe he hath not two hornes like the lambe, nor becauſe he ſpeaketh not like the dragon: but becauſe it is ſaid here of the <hi>beaſt,</hi> that <hi>he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth out of the earth:</hi> for they thinke their Pope hath not a baſe, but a noble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. In deede their firſt biſhops were from heauen, and went to heauen: but they that tooke the <hi>hornes like the lambe,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to challenge ſpirituall &amp; temporall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ouer all the church, were from the <hi>earth:</hi> for this was an earthly deuiſe: &amp; what
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18839:14"/>perſons in the world come to ſo high autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from ſo baſe beginnings, as the Popes of later times? baſtards, and friers, &amp; magicians: are not theſe baſe? are not theſe <hi>from the earth?</hi> To this deſcription of <hi>Iohn,</hi> agreeth that of <hi>Paul:</hi> for as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>he ſhould ſpeake like the dragon,</hi> ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he ſhall be <hi>an aduerſarie:</hi> and as here it is ſaid, he ſhould haue <hi>two hornes like the lambe,</hi> ſo there it is ſaid, that he ſhould <hi>ſit in the Temple of God as God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God:</hi> for he taketh the office &amp; name of God vpon him.</p>
            <p>The third marke is proper alſo to the Pope. For thus <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh of him. <hi>He did all that the first beaſt could doe before him, and cauſed the earth, and them that dwell therein, to worſhip the firſt beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed.</hi> The firſt beaſt was olde <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ſtate of the empire: therefore when this ſecond beaſt had gotten hornes like the lambe, that is ſpirituall and temporall iuriſdiction, hee puſheth ſo long with theſe hornes, that hee maketh the <hi>Romane</hi> name to flouriſh, as much or more then it did before: which was a thing much to be woondered at tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the world. Who knoweth not that <hi>Rome</hi> hath bene theſe later hundred yeeres in more eſtimation then any citie in the world beſides, or then it ſelfe had beene in former
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18839:15"/>times? and how came it to that wealth &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, but onely by the <hi>two horned beaſt?</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els had it to commend it now in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, but the falſe title of the ſeat of <hi>Chriſts</hi> vicar. And heerein ſtandeth all the indeuour of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> not that <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, but that <hi>the firſt beaſt</hi> may be had in honour. For the name, and religion, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of <hi>Rome</hi> he fighteth. The Pope is as it were, <hi>the firſt beast:</hi> for in him the ancient ſtate ſeemeth to be reſtored.</p>
            <p>The fourth note of the ſecond beaſt is as fit as any of the reſt for the pope. For <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth: <hi>He did great woonders, ſo that he made fire to come downe from heauen on the earth in the ſight of men: and deceiued them that dwell on the earth, by the ſignes which were permitted to him to doe in the ſight of the beaſt.</hi> To this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of <hi>Antichrist, whoſe comming is by the working of Satan, with all power and ſignes, and lying woonders.</hi> And our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>There ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and woonders, ſo that if it were poſſible, they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the very elect.</hi> Signes and miracles are ſo common with the papiſtes, as they haue not beene among any ſince the Apoſtles times. They haue miracles to commend euery thing to the world, miracles to confirme purgatory,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18839:15"/>and praying for the dead, and the maſſe, and the force of reliques, and whatſoeuer ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is beſides in poperie. But their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are <hi>lying ſignes &amp; miracles,</hi> both becauſe many of them are but done in ſhew and not in trueth, and many are fained, and all tend to confirme and eſtabliſh lies. The trueth nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no new miracles, it perſuadeth &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it ſelfe in the heart of him that hath it. <hi>Iohn</hi> nameth one eſpeciall miracle, <hi>The cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of fire downe from heauen in the ſight of men.</hi> Some imagine that as <hi>Elias</hi> did it to conſume the fifties that came to take him, ſo the Pope at ſome time or other ſhould do: or as he did to commend his ſacrifice againſt the ſacrifice of the prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> ſo the pope ſhould cauſe the like for the confirmation of his maſſe and other idolatrie. It is time for him now to doe it, if euer he will doe it, for he is neere taking, and his maſſe almoſt euery where is out of credit. There be that refer it to Pope <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,</hi> which by the art of Magike danced in fire, raiſed vp round about him, without hurt, thereby to winne the more authority to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Others rather take this of the fire to be ſpoken allegorically: for what is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, but as it were an heauenly fire, by which he hath reuenged himſelfe on many emperours and kings, and whereby he goeth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18839:16"/>about ſtill to conſume his enemies? This fire he flingeth about him like a madde man. He hath caſt it againſt our moſt gracious <hi>Queene,</hi> and this whole land: but it is quenched in the ſea. I hope it will not ſet any on fire here, as it hath done. <hi>Fox</hi> taketh this fire fetcht from heauen, to be the Scriptures interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a wrong ſence. <hi>Christ</hi> ſayth <hi>he came to cast fire on the earth, and that his deſire was it ſhould be kindled:</hi> ſpeaking of his word. This fire the Pope fetcheth out of heauen: for he wringeth and wreſteth it out of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall place, and applieth it to prooue his authoritie and all ſuperſtition which he hath brought into the world: <hi>This is my body,</hi> and <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke will I build my church:</hi> and many ſuch bright ſhining ſtarres hee hath pluckt <hi>from heauen downe to the earth.</hi> The Pope therefore is that new kinde of <hi>Alchymiſt</hi> that is ſayd to <hi>fetch fire from heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fift marke poynteth out the Pope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. For partly by his <hi>two hornes,</hi> and partly by <hi>fire from heauen,</hi> and by the meanes of his <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignes and miracles,</hi> he is growne to ſuch credit and power, that at his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they that dwell on the earth are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make the <hi>image of the beast, which had the wound of a ſword and did liue, and alſo he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18839:16"/>did giue a ſpirit to the image of the beaſt, ſo that the image of the beaſt did ſpeake.</hi> This making of an image, and the cauſing of it to ſpeake, hath diuerſe interpretations. The Papiſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the head wounded and reuiued to be, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> himſelfe, fayning himſelfe to die and to riſe againe: and that of the image ſpeaking, they vnderſtand of an image which <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhoulde make to repreſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which ſhoulde giue anſweres to thoſe that ſought vnto it. Theſe are vaine deuiſes and ſhifts to put it from the Pope. But the head wounded and healed, is the ſtate of the empire fallen and rayſed againe in the Pope: for <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>wounded with a ſword,</hi> and reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Papacie. The image made by the people, and cauſed to ſpeake by the Pope, ſome haue thought to bee the emperour, which in deede is but the Popes creature, whome he hath put downe and ſet vp, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſpeake or holde his peace at his pleaſure. But it ſeemeth rather to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of his <hi>Legates</hi> and <hi>Cardinalles,</hi> and their Courtes and Conſiſtories in all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: for all people were perſuaded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine them, and the Pope did, as it were, breathe life into them, and they ſpake by the ſpirite of his Canon lawe or abſolute pleaſure.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:18839:17"/>
            <p>The ſixt marke is agreeable in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>He cauſed that as many as would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the image of the beaſt, ſhould be killed.</hi> The reiecting of the Popiſh Legates, and courts, and lawes, the refuſing of the Spaniſh inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, is death. For hence proceede all the warres and rebellions among all people that profeſſe the name of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It perteineth alſo to their bloodſhedding and cruelty, that he ſaith: <hi>None could be ſuffred to buy or ſell, except he receiued the beaſts marke.</hi> For there was no place nor being for any, except he did ſweare ſubiection. And when the patience of Gods people is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for induring ſuch things as they lay vpon them, it is a token of their bloody cruelty. <hi>Here is the patience of ſaints: here are they that keepe the commandements of God, &amp; the faith of Ieſus.</hi> And in the iuſtifying of their puniſhment, which daily now falleth vpon them, the cauſe is giuen: <hi>for they ſhed the blood of the ſaints and prophets, and therefore haſt thou giuen them blood to drinke, for they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie.</hi> Her attire and ornaments alſo doe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this thirſt and ſhedding of blood that hath bene, &amp; is in them. <hi>I ſaw a woman ſit vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſcarlet coloured beast: and the woman was arrayed in purple and ſcarlet.</hi> What colour ſo fit for a bloody beaſt? and what kinde of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple either vſed or eſteemed it ſo much as they?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18839:17"/>To theſe things agreeth that which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaieth, hauing relation to the latter times. <hi>The time will come when they that kill you ſhall thinke they doe God good ſeruice.</hi> But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue this note from themſelues, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſay, that the killing which they haue exerciſed, is not anſwerable to thoſe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: for they ſay the <hi>latter beaſt</hi> muſt kill mo of Gods ſcruants then the <hi>firſt beaſt,</hi> and with more crueltie. I finde not yet where it is ſo ſayd, but that is true in them although they denie it. For who can reckon vp the number, that iudicially for the cauſe of poperie haue bin put to death in <hi>England, Scotland France, Spaine,</hi> and all the countries of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> within theſe two or three hundred yeres? And as for inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting of torments, if burning by fire be not cruell inough, yet they haue deuiſed more exquiſite torments in their <hi>Spaniſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,</hi> &amp; vſed much more crueltie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer the Heathen did. And one thing they haue committed whereby they haue ſhed infinite mens blood, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heathen did not againſt the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> They make warre vpon vs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for religion, &amp; in thoſe wars in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germanie</hi> &amp; the low countries, &amp; in all places where by inuaſion or rebellion they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, haue made infinit ſlaughters. Wherfore numbers ſlaine by them exceed the number
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18839:18"/>ſlayne by <hi>Paganes.</hi> But there is not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely any thing ſpoken of the number. They kill all, and would doe, that will not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to them. This they haue practiſed, and this they doe practiſe: this is the drift of their warres and Counſels, and indeuours, and this is the marke of the beaſt. I ſawe the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (ſayth <hi>Iohn) druncken with the blood of Saintes, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Ieſus.</hi> Although we kill many in theſe warres, yet the whole is to be imputed vnto them: for they are the cauſe of the ſlaughter, not onely of others, but alſo of themſelues.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenth note is, that <hi>the beaſt made all both ſmall and great, rich and poore, free and bond, to receaue a marke in their right hand, or in their foreheads, and that no man might buy or ſell, but he that had the marke, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name. Here is wiſedome: let him that hath wit, count the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the beaſt: for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.</hi> There is no Religion that euer was, that hath ſo many markes and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and ſo gloryeth in them, as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion. And all that are vnder them, are ſigned with ſome token or other, as their ſheepe. Their little infants, with their oyle, and creame, and other matters. Their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and kings, and all men that take degrees
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18839:18"/>in ſchooles, with their corporal othe, for their fidelitie to that See. Their Byſhops &amp; whole Cleargie, with their ſhauen crownes, &amp; oyle, and othes. All the people by open profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be of the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church,</hi> for to this end tend al their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. This they would haue all come vnto, and they obteined it, that they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues to be of the <hi>Latine</hi> &amp; <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion. Therefore Maiſter <hi>Foxe</hi> taketh this name to bee <hi>Romanus.</hi> Which both in the Greeke, and alſo in the Hebrewe letters ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth 666. He trieth it in both tongues: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thinketh the Reuelation was made to <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Hebrewe,</hi> as being his mother tongue, and therefore in the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> name the number ſhould be anſwerable: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wrote it in <hi>Greeke,</hi> it ſhould agree in that tongue alſo, which it doth in <hi>Romanus.</hi> For both the letters in Hebrewe, and the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Greeke make that number. <hi>Irenaens</hi> coniectured <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be the name: and many learned men do reſt in that, and it fitly agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For all things with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were in Latine: the ſcripture, their publike ſeruice, their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate prayers, their lawes, all were Latine. But this deuiſe of the letters in a name to make vp the number, ſeemeth to be <hi>Magical,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balistical,</hi> &amp; not vſed in the ſcriptures (as ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18839:19"/>learned mens opinion is,) and therefore they thinke the number ſhould ſhew the time when he ſhould bee brought foorth into the world. And about that time they account that the Pope obtained his title of <hi>vniuerſall biſhop</hi> by a Councell: hee had it giuen him by the emperour <hi>Phocas</hi> about 60. yeeres before. So that which way ſoeuer it bee taken, it falleth out right, and agreeth ſtill to them. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſtandeth the note of Gods people to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and reiect this marke and character, and by no meanes to be counted of that religion, for they are threatened that do receiue it: <hi>If any man worſhip the beast and his image, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his marke in his forehead or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, yea of the pure wine which is powred into the cup of his wrath, and he ſhall be tormented in fire and brimſtone before the holy Angels, and before the Lambe, and the ſmoke of their torment ſhall aſcend euermore, and they ſhall haue no reſt day nor night, which worſhip the beaſt and his image, and whoſoeuer receiueth the print of his name.</hi> But if any withſtand it and get the victorie, they are highly commended. Thus <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh of them: <hi>And I ſawe as it were a glaſſie ſea, mingled with fire, and them that had gotten victorie of the beast and of his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and of his marke, ſtanding at the glaſſie
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18839:19"/>ſea, hauing the harpes of God, and they did ſing the ſong of Moſes the ſeruaunt of God, and the ſong of the Lambe.</hi> Afterward hee ſheweth how there fell a noyſome and grieuous ſore vpon the men which had the marke of the beaſt, and vpon them which worſhipped his image. This ſore of many is thought to bee the French diſeaſe, which began among them in the warre at <hi>Naples</hi> betweene the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in the yeere 1494. it came by the companie of harlots in the campe, and from thence was ſpred to moſt countreys. Other writers expound it of the plague, which in the time of poperie flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, was more fierce and more generall in all theſe quarters then almoſt at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or ſince: all chronicles are full of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Thus much of the receiuing the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and marke of the beaſt, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth note.</p>
            <p>It were long to deſcribe the other notes of this beaſt, for there are yet many things whereby it may bee knowen. The ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter hath a full deſcription of it. That chapter hath much that pertaineth to <hi>Rome</hi> vnder the Emperours, and much alſo belonging to it, as it is gouerned by the Pope. Nay, both are as it were knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that they are ſo like: for this that is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18839:20"/>nowe, is but the olde reuiued, and therefore he that knoweth one, knoweth both. The firſt and eſpeciall marke is their whoriſh and idolatrous Religion. For hee calleth her <hi>the whore that ſitteth vpon many waters:</hi> the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement ouer many people that maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth idolatrie, which is ſpirituall fornication in the ſight of God. Then he ſayth: <hi>With her haue committed fornication the kings of the earth, and the inhabitants of the earth are drunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the wine of her fornication.</hi> For what Idole did the Romans ſet vp, which kings and people did not by and by embrace? And they receaued them ſo gladly, and maintained all their <hi>will worſhip,</hi> their Saintes, their Images, their Reliques, their Maſſes, their ceremonies in ſuch ſorte, as if they were druncke with the loue of them. Yet touching their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſaith, that this woman was <hi>full of names of blaſphemie.</hi> Blaſphemie is that which hurts the name of God. They were full then of blaſphemies, that hurt the name of God, and the name of his people. Himſelfe to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the vicar of Chriſt vpon earth, the head of the Church, the vniuerſall biſhop, is a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and againſt all other <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Pastours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſaye that Saintes are interceſſors and mediators for vs, is blaſphemie againſt the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18839:20"/>Saintes, and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> To affirme that <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his death put away originall ſinne onely, and ſatiſfied for the fault of other ſinnes, and not for the puniſhment, is blaſphemie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Christes</hi> paſſion. So is that which they affirme of the Maſſe, that it is a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the quicke and the dead. Theſe and infinite thinges more in that Religion, are vile and horrible blaſphemies. <hi>Iohn</hi> is not yet ſatiſfied with ſpeaking thus much onely of their idolatrie: but hee ſaith afterwarde, that <hi>ſhe had a cup of gould in her hand, full of abominations and filthines of her fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Shee had a goulden cup, not onely for her riches and wealth, but alſo for a ſhewe of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion and holynes. But this golden cup was full of poyſon, ful of <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> and <hi>filthie fornication.</hi> For what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or meaſure, or end was there of their Idoles? not onely euery citie as in <hi>Iuda,</hi> but euery houſe, euery corner, euery man had his Idole. Neither that alone, but there was for euery action, for euery occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for euery diſeaſe, a ſeuerall Idole. Laſt of all, for the fertilitie of her idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> calleth her the mother of whoredomes and abominations of the earth. For where was the ſhoppe where theſe Idoles were deuiſed? Whence were
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18839:21"/>they authorized but onely from <hi>Rome?</hi> Theſe things that <hi>Iohn</hi> writeth of the idolatrie of the beaſt, will not agree to the <hi>Antichrist</hi> that the Papiſts imagine: for they ſay he ſhall aboliſh all other images, and make his owne image onely be worſhipped: for the beaſt is the mother of all abominations and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth: neither will it ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to auncient <hi>Rome,</hi> for that receiued ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Idoles from other people, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the gods of all other nations which they conquered. But this beaſt ſendeth out her Idoles and Saintes and pettie gods, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth them to the worſhippers, promiſing great things if they doe it.</p>
            <p>Another marke followeth, that ſhe hath in her forehead a name written: <hi>A myſterie.</hi> This verie name in letters was written on the Popes Myter, which hee did weare vpon his head, and ſo they vſed it for a ſeaſon. Their <hi>Myters</hi> were branded with this marke, <hi>Mysterium.</hi> But they after tooke it out, and now they vſe not to beare that name in their foreheads. But in the forehead of the whore, that is, of their whoriſh Religion, it is written ſtill: but none ſaue Gods elect can reade it. For the poyſon and infection of their Religion is ſecrete: It hath a goodly ſhewe, it beguileth many. For they keepe the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18839:21"/>names of Scripture, and <hi>Christian</hi> religion, but they haue turned them into another meaning, yea they commend the baſeſt and vileſt ceremonie that they vſe, as a great <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.</hi> Wherefore albeit the name <hi>myſterium</hi> be taken out of the Popes <hi>miter,</hi> yet it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſtill in the forehead of his religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> commeth yet neerer, and pointeth out the very place vnto vs: for he calleth it <hi>great Babylon.</hi> for as <hi>Babylon</hi> had the Monarchie, and oppreſſed and caried captiue Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: ſo likewiſe did both the olde and the newe <hi>Rome:</hi> the firſt and the latter beaſt, and ſo he calleth it, when he ſpeaketh of the fall thereof. <hi>It is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon the great citie.</hi> And in many other thinges was <hi>Rome</hi> like to <hi>Babylon,</hi> as in the building, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Monarchie and oppreſſion of the Saintes. All this the Papiſtes will graunt of olde <hi>Rome,</hi> but not of newe <hi>Rome.</hi> But if the <hi>first beast</hi> be olde <hi>Rome,</hi> and the latter reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the firſt, then the firſt being <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſecond muſt needes alſo be <hi>Rome:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while he pointeth out one, he pointeth out both.</p>
            <p>Some Papiſtes haue imagined that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> ſhould make his ſeate at <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Eaſt, or there be borne, and ſo the name to be taken here in his proper ſignification. But
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18839:22"/>why then doeth he call it a <hi>mysterie? There is in her forehead a name written, a mysterie, great Babylon.</hi> It is <hi>Babylon</hi> in a <hi>myſterie,</hi> and not in the proper ſignification of the name. To point out <hi>Rome</hi> by the dominion which it had by the Empire, and ſhould haue by the popedome, he ſayeth further: <hi>The waters which thou ſawest where the whore ſitteth, are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues:</hi> and afterwarde more plainely, <hi>The woman which thou ſawest, is the great citie, which reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ouer the kings of the earth.</hi> Two or three notes yet he addeth to deſcribe the citie, and gouernment, and authoritie thereof. One when he ſayth: <hi>The beast that thou haſt ſeene, was, and is not.</hi> And againe: <hi>The beaſt that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> The Monarchie was there vnder <hi>Auguſtus, Tiberius,</hi> and ſome that followed, moſt flouriſhing, but now in <hi>Iohns</hi> time is not, and yet is. for vnder <hi>Domitian</hi> it did not flouriſh, and therefore was not in compariſon of that it had bene, and yet was then: for it had great power. But after this, it ſhould aſcende out of the bottomleſſe pit, euen out of hell, by the ſubtiltie of the deuill, after it was quite ouerthrowne by the <hi>Goths.</hi> for it was reuiued and quickned in the Pope, and <hi>Rome</hi> had as much authoritie by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, and as much riches as euer it had by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18839:22"/>the Monarchie.</p>
            <p>The other note is, when he ſaith: <hi>I will ſhew thee the myſterie of the woman, and of the beaſt that beareth her, which hath ſeuen heades, and ten hornes.</hi> But of the ten hornes, becauſe they are ſet for ten kings, I will ſpeake afterward, when I ſhall ſpeake of the kings that ioyne with the beaſt, in the fight againſt him that rideth on the horſe. Therefore of the ſeuen heades thus he ſaith. <hi>Here is the minde that hath wiſedome. The ſeuen heades are ſeuen mountaines, whereon the woman ſitteth, they are alſo ſeuen Kings.</hi> Firſt of the <hi>mountaines,</hi> then of the <hi>Kings.</hi> The woman ſitteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeuen hils, and the woman is a citie. <hi>Rome</hi> then on ſeuen hils, and the latter beaſt reuiueth the firſt. No matter if this <hi>Rome</hi> ſtande not vpon all ſeuen, nay if it ſtande vpon none of them, ſo that it ſtande for that <hi>Rome</hi> that ſtoode vpon them, hath that name and dignitie, and anſwereth to it in i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous religion, and cruell perſecution of the Saints. Then was <hi>Rome</hi> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to ſtande on ſeuen hils. No other citie did ſo: no other citie bearing rule ouer Kinges doeth ſo. It was called <hi>Septicollis,</hi> of the ſeuen chiefe hils, whereon it ſtoode. <hi>Virgil</hi> hath relation to them, when hee ſayeth: <hi>Septem quae vna ſibi muro circumde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18839:23"/>arces:</hi> Meaning by towres the hilles on which that ſtoode. And <hi>Propertius</hi> ſayeth: <hi>Septem vrbs alta nigis toto quae praeſidet orbi. Romulus</hi> ſette it on foure hilles, which were called <hi>Palatinus, Capitolinus, Auentinus,</hi> and <hi>Exquilinus.</hi> Afterward <hi>Seruius Tullus</hi> added three, which were <hi>Caelius, Viminalis,</hi> and <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinalis.</hi> From this time was it called <hi>Septicol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> although when it was further inlarged, it comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded mo hils. And the ſecond beaſt with his kingdome and dominion, is moſt fitly deſcribed by the citie: for they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all their priuiledges by the citie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Peter</hi> (they ſay) was <hi>Biſhoppe</hi> there, thence, euen from the place, they deriue all their authoritie. There they delight to dwell, although other cities are more pleaſant and commodious. There the <hi>Cardinals</hi> muſt meete, when they chooſe the Pope: there all the counſels and conſpiracies are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods Church. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh ſo great account of the citie, that if the Pope ſhould be driuen thence, or it be deſtroied, yet whereſoeuer he were, he ſhould ſtill haue the honour and dignitie and title of the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus here by the ſeuen hils, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place is noted. As in this Chapter <hi>Rome</hi> is moſt expreſly deſcribed: ſo of learned men, in the ſixteenth it is thought almoſt to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18839:23"/>They gather themſelues together in a place called in Hebrewe <hi>Armageddon. Foxe</hi> and others, take it to be an alluſion to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giddo,</hi> and <hi>Har megiddo</hi> the riuer and hill ſo called, where <hi>Siſera</hi> with his armie was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, which ſhould ſignifie the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent to the battels of the beaſt. But for as much as it may be read, &amp; ſo in ſome bookes was in two wordes, each of two ſyllables, <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma geddon,</hi> and <hi>Sigonius</hi> ſaith, he ſawe it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Geddon harma:</hi> and the letter N. is not in the name of the place where <hi>Siſera</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, therefore it is thought that ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then the alluſion to <hi>Megiddo,</hi> muſt be found in the letters, &amp; the ſignification of the word. If <hi>Iohn</hi> had meant the place <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giddo,</hi> he neede not haue ſaid it is named ſo in Hebrewe, for the name only would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vs to that place, although he had left out the mention of the language.</p>
            <p>The ſignification of <hi>Geddon harma</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well to the <hi>Rome</hi> that nowe is: for it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>excidium excelſae,</hi> the ruine of the high citie, &amp; it alludeth to that of <hi>Sibylla,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rome</hi> a ruine. This ſhould be the place and ſhop of all conſpiracies againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Goſpell. <hi>Harma</hi> ſignifieth the high citie that hath dominion ouer the reſt, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in ſounde very little from <hi>Haroma,</hi> and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18839:24"/>ſhort in Hebrew it might ſo be written, <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> In the place where this ancient great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was cut downe by the <hi>Goths,</hi> there the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was erected or hard by, in ſteede of it, and thence come all miſchiefes to <hi>Chriſtes</hi> Church. There are the battels conſpired and made. What could be ſaid plainer to deſcribe the citie, then that of the ſeuen hils, or this of <hi>Harma,</hi> ſo neere in ſounde to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in ſence <hi>the high and mightie citie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe as concerning the kings, there are two orders of them pertaining to the citie: firſt <hi>ſeuen,</hi> and then <hi>ten. Seuen heads are alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen kings, and ten hornes be ten kings.</hi> But the ten kings are kings aſſiſting, and with power helping the beaſt at the firſt, and after as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ready to pul downe the beaſt as they were to ſet him vp. But of thoſe aſſiſting kings afterward. The 7. kings are the ſtates of <hi>Rome</hi> in it ſelfe, ſucceeding one another from the beginning to the end, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, which is manifeſt, becauſe he ſaith thus. <hi>The 7. hils are alſo 7. kings, fiue are fallen, and one is, and another is not yet come, and when he commeth, he muſt continue a ſhort ſpace, and the beaſt that was, and is not, is euen the eight, and is one of the ſeuen, and ſhall goe into deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> They that expound this of <hi>Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Veſpaſian,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> fiue paſt, &amp; <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:18839:24"/>preſent, &amp; <hi>Cocceius Nerua</hi> the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, &amp; the eight <hi>Traian</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> ſay nothing to the purpoſe. For beſides that <hi>Iohns</hi> propheſie could not be ſhut vp in ſo ſhort a compaſſe, &amp; not onely 5. but moe Emperors were paſt, no man can tell howe <hi>Traian</hi> ſhould be the eight, and yet one of the ſeuen that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And to vnderſtande it of the ſeuen Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Empire, is much further from the matter, for none of them were then, much leſſe fiue paſt alreadie. The ſeuen kings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are the ſeuen ſtates of gouernment in <hi>Rome,</hi> from the building of it, whereof fiue were paſt before S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time: for firſt they were gouerned by <hi>Kings,</hi> ſecondly by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls,</hi> thirdly by <hi>Decemuiros,</hi> fourthly by <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umuiros,</hi> and fifthly by <hi>Dictators:</hi> all which were paſt, and in effect were kings, although not in name. The ſixt were the Emperors that reigned in <hi>Iohns</hi> tyme, and after, till <hi>Rome</hi> was deſtroyed. The ſeuenth is thought to bee the popedome, which hath ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Emperours: and he is alſo the eight, for hee ſuſtaineth two gouernments, one temporall, another ſpirituall, and his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all gouernment is one of the ſeuen, for it is alſo externall, and in pompe like that of the Emperours. Wherefore they would make him the ſeuenth, and the eight too, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18839:25"/>his ſpirituall dominion which is the eight, is alſo temporall, and ſo one of the ſeuen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is exerciſed after a temporall maner. But this diuiding and applying of the pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vnto two or three ſtates, is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, eſpecially when the ſeuenth which they make his temporall gouernment, ſhould laſt but a ſhort time, and yet it hath laſted longer then any of the other gouernments. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ſay that the gouernment of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> or rather the <hi>Exarchi</hi> of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> (for they helde <hi>Rome</hi> a ſeaſon) was the ſeuenth, and that laſted but a ſhort time, &amp; then came the popedome which is like one of the ſeuen, for he is a prieſtly king or emperour. To make <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> one of the ſeuen, that is not ſo fit, becauſe the <hi>Pontifex</hi> as <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex</hi> neuer had entire and ſoueraigne go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of all: and he ſucceeded not the other gouernments, but was a companion to them all. Neither did <hi>Tribuni</hi> rule as chiefe Magiſtrats, but were interceſſors for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with the chiefe Magiſtrate. Thus hath <hi>Iohn</hi> euidently deſcribed <hi>Rome</hi> vnto vs, with the double perſecuting ſtate thereof. There is no citie can be ſhewed to haue altered the kind of gouernment ſo oft: and if others may be found to haue done it, yet the other marks together with this, agree to none but this.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:18839:25"/>
            <p>Beſides theſe thinges in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> there remaineth ſomwhat in <hi>Paul,</hi> pertaining to the deſcription of this beaſt, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his intollerable pride. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, he exalteth himſelfe againſt all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God, or that is worſhipped, ſo that he doeth ſit as God in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God.</hi> This the Papiſtes deny to agree to the Pope: and therefore thinke he is not that proud beaſt, for (ſay they) he calleth him ſelfe <hi>ſeruum ſeruorum Dei,</hi> &amp; acknowledgeth himſelf the vicar of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo farre is he from making himſelfe <hi>Christ</hi> and God in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and he praieth to God &amp; Chriſt, and kneeleth at his altars humbly. But he muſt be meaſured, not by his hypocriticall actions, nor by his wordes in his hypocriſie, but by the nature and kinde of his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith, that he exalteth himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all that is called God, or is <hi>auguſtum</hi> in earth, when he lifteth himſelfe aboue Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and kings, for they are not gods, but are called gods, and they are <hi>Augusti,</hi> they are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in earth, they of all men ſhould haue honour and worſhip giuen to them. But the Emperors and kings he hath ſo debaſed, that he hath made them thinke it ſome honor for them to kiſſe his foote. The Pope hath cauſed the Emperour to holde his ſtirope: hee hath
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18839:26"/>put his feete in the Emperours necke, he hath fed a Prince like a dogge vnder his table, and he hath turned the imperiall crowne from the heade with his foote: hee hath made the Emperour attend at his gate bare footed. In this behalfe they haue done that alſo which pertaineth onely to God, for they will giue and take away kingdomes at their pleaſure. Thus in one ſence they haue exalted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues aboue all that is called God, or that is worſhipped, and ſhewed themſelues as God. And they haue ſhewed themſelues as God many other waies, in reſpect of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, either in holding it gilty, or in acquiting it, for that pertaineth onely to God. But they would bind it by their lawes, &amp; interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſcriptures, &amp; thundring of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the innocent, &amp; looſe it by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing ſinnes, &amp; granting pardons &amp; diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations in all kind of things. Thus haue they ſhewed themſelues as God in the Temple of God in reſpect of mens conſciences. And in reſpect of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; hel, &amp; purgatory, he hath prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to rule as God in al theſe places: for he will make ſaints in heauen, whome he wil, and hold in purgatorie, or let out whome he liſt: and for this laſt, it is no marueile, for it is of his owne making. Laſt of all in his lawes, and by his flatterers hee hath beene called
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18839:26"/>God in plaine termes, and he hath ſuffered it. There it is written, <hi>Dominus Deus noster Papa:</hi> our Lord God the Pope: and againe, <hi>Tues omnia, &amp; ſuper omnia,</hi> Thou art all, and aboue all. Howe can any creature ſhewe him ſelfe as God in Gods temple more preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly then by theſe meanes, or more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? for otherwiſe in flat termes to proclaime himſelfe as God to be honoured with diuine honour, it is too groſſe, and it is not ſuch a craftie <hi>mysterie,</hi> as ſhould deceaue a meane man, much leſſe bring into danger Gods <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</hi> To theſe things agree the words of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> which many take as ſpoken of purpoſe of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> or at leaſt they are applied to him by the Fathers. <hi>The king ſhal do what him liſt, he ſhal exalt himſelfe, and magnifie himſelf againſt all that is called God, and ſhall ſpeake marueilous things againſt the God of gods, and ſhall proſper till the wrath be accompliſhed: for the determination is made, neither ſhall he regarde the God of his Fathers, nor care for any God, for he ſhall magnifie himſelfe aboue all. Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeake of their pride in lifting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues aboue Magiſtrates, ſaying, that they ſhould deſpiſe gouernment, and ſpeake euill of them that are in authoritie.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the markes of this beaſt: other might be added out of <hi>Daniel, Paul,</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:18839:27"/>as that they ſhal worſhip God with gold and ſiluer, for all their religion ſtoode in outward worldly oſtentation: that they ſhould <hi>forbid mariage and meates,</hi> as they make great holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in ſingle life, &amp; accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mariage vncleane, and the eating of fleſh at certaine times, they vtterly condemne as vnholie. That likewiſe they ſhould be rich and mighty, and ſhould make merchandiſe of all things, yea of mens ſoules: for they as in way of religion ſolde wood, ſtones, incenſe, oile, and all things, if they had dedicated them once to ſome holie vſe, they were coſtly merchandiſe, although otherwiſe the vileſt things that might be. All theſe markes agree moſt fitly to the <hi>Romiſh Antichriſt,</hi> &amp; to none other. The Pope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is <hi>the beaſt,</hi> which being aided by the kings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, fighteth againſt <hi>Ieſus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the marks which the Papiſtes make of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> they touch him not, they come not neere him. They imagine he ſhould be of the tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> becauſe that tribe is not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the tribes, of which many are marked to be ſaued. A weake foundation: the tribe is there omitted, therfore <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhal come of that tribe. Thus they ground their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of that which the Scripture hath not ſaid. And as for <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> to come and preach againſt him in their owne perſons,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18839:27"/>which they ſay they haue not done againſt the Pope, and therefore he is not that beaſt, that is a thing imagined as the other: for no Scripture hath ſaide, that they two ſhoulde come, but they ground it on this that <hi>Christ</hi> ſayth: <hi>Elias ſhould come, and reſtore all things,</hi> which was fulfilled at his firſt comming, and that two witneſſes are promiſed to be ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Antichrist,</hi> which are vnderſtood by many to be <hi>Iohn Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Hierom of Prage,</hi> both burned at the Councel of <hi>Constance,</hi> or as others expound it of a ſufficient number, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince the errors of <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> for the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh 2. witneſſes a ſufficient trial. And this age hath ſent out many witneſſes againſt him. That alſo which they ſay is not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, &amp; yet muſt be before the comming of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is falſe: which is, that the goſpell muſt firſt be publikely preached, &amp; receaued in all kingdomes of the world: but it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where ſaide, that this ſhould be before the comming of <hi>Antichrist. Chriſt</hi> ſayth, that the Goſpell ſhould be preached through the worlde, before the ende ſhould come. And it is one thing for the Goſpell to be preached, and another thing to bee receaued. It hath bene preached, that is, by ſome meanes made knowne to all nations, but it hath not bene publikely receaued of al nations by common
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18839:28"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent. Another thing that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth neere this, is that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that there muſt be an apoſtaſie firſt. A falling away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith, &amp; not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> is meant by it. For <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, vſing that word to <hi>Timothie,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſome ſhal fal from the faith,</hi> &amp; the word is not vſed otherwiſe in ſcripture. And the Apoſtle ſeemeth ſo to expounde it afterward himſelfe, when he ſaieth, <hi>becauſe men receaued not the loue of the truth, that they might be ſaued:</hi> for if they receaued not the loue of the truth, it ſeemed they had the truth, but loued it not, &amp; therefore were thus puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Wherefore there muſt be a falling away from the faith, &amp; from the loue of the trueth, and <hi>ſtrong deluſion to beleeue lies,</hi> where <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> is. Theſe thinges came to paſſe in pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. So much therfore as is ſaid concerning the goſpel to be receaued or forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before or in the kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is fulfilled in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Yet they ſay the Pope is free from one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial &amp; notable marke of <hi>the beaſt.</hi> What is that? <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>he that denieth that Ieſus is Chriſt, the ſame is Antichriſt.</hi> And againe, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſpirit which confeſſeth not that Ieſus is come in the fleſh, is not of God, but this is the ſpirite of Antichriſt.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> agreeably ſaith, <hi>they ſhal deny the Lorde that bought them.</hi> And <hi>Iude</hi> in like maner: <hi>they deny God the only Lord, &amp; our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18839:28"/>Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And ſomwhat like it by way of affirmation, is that of <hi>Daniel, he ſhall honour the God whom his fathers knew not.</hi> This marke (they ſay) of <hi>denying Chriſt,</hi> the Popes haue not. If they haue not this marke alſo, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue none of the reſt. Large bookes are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this, to ſhew how they deny <hi>Chriſt.</hi> They deny him to be <hi>the king</hi> ouer his Church, for the Pope maketh himſelfe the king. But ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he acknowledgeth himſelf Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes deputie. But it is certaine, that <hi>Christ</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded any ſuch deputie, nor vicar: &amp; if he wil be Chriſts deputie againſt the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure &amp; wil of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or if he were deputed, yet rule otherwiſe then <hi>Christ</hi> would haue him, &amp; only according to his own affection &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, doth he not thruſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? As though one might not cal himſelfe a deputie, &amp; yet draw all to himſelfe, ſo doth the Pope, howbeit, Chriſt neuer ordained ſuch a deputie. Therefore while he will be as <hi>Christ,</hi> and for <hi>Christ,</hi> he is made againſt him, and is <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Furthermore, he doeth not ſuffer <hi>Christ</hi> to be the onely and ſufficient <hi>Prophet</hi> to his Church, which hath reuealed fully the will of the father to it: for partly he ſhutteth vp his Teſtament, and will not haue the people reade it, and partly hee orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth other lawes, as neceſſarie to ſaluation,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18839:29"/>as the lawes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his decrees, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he interpreteth the wordes of <hi>Christ,</hi> not according to <hi>Christs</hi> meaning, but according to his owne fancie, to eſtabliſh his owne earthly kingdome. Laſt of all, hee denieth to <hi>Christ</hi> alſo his <hi>prieſthood:</hi> for neyther doth he admitte the ſacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by himſelfe, in his owne perſon vpon the Croſſe, as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for ſaluation, but he ordaineth another ſacrifice of the Maſſe, and ſatisfactorie works of penance, &amp; mens merites to redeeme their owne ſinnes. Neither doeth he permit <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the only interceſſor &amp; maker of requeſt to the father for his people, but hee ioyneth with him, or ſubſtituteth vnder him the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine <hi>Marie,</hi> and a great number of ſaintes of his owne creation. Thus he denieth <hi>Ieſus</hi> to be <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; ſheweth himſelf to be an enemie vnto him, &amp; the very <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Wherfore al the notes &amp; markes of the beaſt fal vpon him. This is <hi>the beaſt</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh of, which doeth aſſociate to himſelfe <hi>the kings of the earth, &amp; their armies, &amp; maketh warre againſt Chriſt &amp; his army.</hi> This is now our enemie, he &amp; his kings fight againſt vs. It is good for vs to thinke of him as he is, and as he is called in Scripture. Let vs not thinke of him, as of an holie Father, <hi>Chriſtes</hi> Vicar, a ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the pillar of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> religion, the higheſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18839:29"/>Byſhop, a god in earth, as the Papiſtes and his owne ſeruants and flatterers (ſo manie as haue not receiued the loue of the trueth, ſuch, whoſe names are not written in the booke of life) doe eſteeme him. But let vs thinke of him as of <hi>the great whore, the mother of all fornication in the earth,</hi> for his idolatrie: as of <hi>Babylon</hi> for his perſecuting Empire: as <hi>of an Apostata</hi> for his falling from the true faith: as of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and the enemie of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for denying the ſufficiencie of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Sacrifice and interceſſion, for expelling <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of his throne of gouernement, and ſtepping into it himſelfe: for diſplacing <hi>Chriſts</hi> word and corrupting it, and putting his owne word in the roome thereof. Let vs account him as <hi>the beaſt,</hi> that hath not one ſhape, but the properties of manie beaſtes, and therefore a monſtrous beaſt. Proude lyke the Lyon, cruell lyke the Beare, filthie like the Swine, full of poyſon through his blaſphemies like the Dragon, and yet in ſhewe of <hi>hornes like the Lambe.</hi> This is the leader and captaine of all our enemies, if we yeelde to them, wee yeelde to the <hi>beaſt,</hi> and <hi>the beaſt</hi> will make vs beaſtes like himſelfe. Wee muſt beare <hi>the beastes</hi> marke. God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs from him, and repreſſe his furie, and confounde his enterpriſes, and ouerthrowe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18839:30"/>his kingdome. Thus much of the beaſt.</p>
            <p>The beaſt fighteth not alone againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his people: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he were not much to be feared: but he hath firſt kings, and then his owne &amp; their armies to aſſiſt him. Firſt wil I ſpeake of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their armies. Kings were propheſied to be ſubiect to him. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſaith to <hi>Iohn. The ten horns which thou ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, are tenkings, which yet haue not receaued a kingdome, but ſhall receaue power as kings at one houre with the beaſt. Theſe haue one minde, and ſhal giue their power and authoritie to the beaſt. Theſe ſhal fight with the Lambe, and the Lambe ſhal ouercome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For he is Lord of Lords, &amp; king of kings: &amp; they that are on his ſide, called, &amp; cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, &amp; faithful.</hi> Againe he ſaith: <hi>The ten hornes which thou ſaweſt vpon the beaſt, are they that ſhal hate the whore, &amp; ſhal make her deſolate &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, &amp; ſhall eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his wil, &amp; to doe with one conſent, for to giue their kingdom vnto the beaſt, vntill the words of God be fufilled.</hi> Thus kings ſhal ſubiect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to <hi>the beaſt,</hi> ſhal giue their authoritie to him, ſhal fight for him ſo long as God hath appointed. The loue of theſe kings to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; their obedience is expreſſed, which they ſhewed to it in time of the proſperitie thereof in this maner: <hi>With her haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted fornication the kings of the earth.</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:18839:30"/>And in the time of the decay of it in this ſort. <hi>The kings of the earth ſhall bewaile her, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for her, which haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted fornication, &amp; liued in pleaſure with her, when they ſhall ſee the ſmoke of her burning.</hi> What other ſtate hath there bin, or is in the world, vnto which kings haue willingly ſubiected themſelues, and yet remaine kings, but this? If any be vnder the great <hi>Turke,</hi> the name of kings, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ceaſeth by and by: He onely will be king. But in Poperie, the kings ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; become ſeruants, &amp; tributarie, &amp; yet remaine kings, &amp; take pleaſure in this ſubiection, and ſtriue againſt al others that will not be ſlaues &amp; bondmen as wel as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Theſe kings had the ſame occaſion &amp; time of beginning their kingdomes that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſt had.

To finde that they were iuſt ten, and neither more nor leſſe, it is hard: but ten may be ſet for a perfect and full number, riſing of all the Vnities. The occaſion of the riſing of the Popedome, &amp; of theſe kingdomes, was one and the ſame, and at once began: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the Popedome ſhewed not it ſelfe in his great pride and high name of <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> Byſhop, till <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> in the yeare ſixe hundreth and ſixe. Then <hi>Rome</hi> was great with childe of this <hi>beaſt,</hi> yea, and brought him forth, and gaue him the name. But hee did growe vp after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in great haſte, till he became the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt in the Weſt partes of the worlde. But his growing was by the ſuppreſſing of the Empire, and by ſucking of ſtrength from the Emperor, and from theſe kings. The firſt milke that hee did ſucke, was that title gotten of <hi>Phocas,</hi> that hee might be called and taken to bee the <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall high Byſhop of all the world. Before that time, the other Patriarkes were equall with him: but by this title, hee was ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them and all other Byſhops. Then hee obtained more milke of the Emperour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee had much a doe to get it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18839:37"/>that the Emperour ſhould not confirme him: but his election ſhould bee ratified by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and not by the Emperor. When hee had this, then hee was able to goe alone. After this, he obtaineth yet more plentifull nouriſhment, and beginneth to ſwallowe downe ſtronge meate. Hee obtaineth by much ſtriuing, the inueſtiture and placing of all Byſhops in <hi>Italie,</hi> and the Emperors do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and at length in all the Weſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. By this, <hi>the beaſt</hi> was growen ſo ſtrong, that he would nowe take vpon him to feede or famiſh his father and feeder. For he would make the Emperour, or elſe hee ſhould be no Emperour: hee would excommunicate him, and depoſe him at his pleaſure. And hauing wraſtled and ouercome him, it was an eaſie matter for him to ouercome the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kings. Nay the Emperors and kings did willingly giue <hi>the beaſt</hi> thoſe thinges, which made him ſtrong, and themſelues weake. For they ſware obedience to him, and that they would not diminiſh his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor commodities, or dominions. <hi>Edelwul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> king of the <hi>Weſt Saxons</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> was the firſt that made his land tributarie to the Pope, in the yeare eight hundred fortie and ſixe. And as this land receaued the yoke firſt, ſo firſt it caſt it off vnder king Henrie
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18839:38"/>the eight. By occaſion that the Emperours in the Eaſt deſtroied images, and for want of might could not holde vp the ſtate of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the <hi>Longobards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated the Emperours of the Eaſt one after another, and called <hi>Carolus magnus</hi> the king of <hi>Fraunce</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> for his aide, and there made the people proclaime him Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and he himſelfe anointed him, in the yeere 801. Thus <hi>Charles</hi> being an Emperour of the Popes owne making, conferred vpon the Pope a great part of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to requite him, made him riche. After that part of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> other kingdomes by ſundrie occaſions came vnder the Pope. The <hi>Sclauonians</hi> would vſe their owne tongue in their publike ſeruice of God, but they were content to doe it by the Popes permiſſion, and ſo declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſubiect to him, <hi>an.</hi> 861. When <hi>Miesko</hi> king of <hi>Poland</hi> embraced the faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; appointed biſhops in his kingdome, <hi>Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes 13.</hi> ſendeth one <hi>Giles</hi> the <hi>Tuſculan</hi> biſhop &amp; <hi>Cardinal,</hi> to conſecrate his biſhops after the maner of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; ſo maketh <hi>Poland</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to himſelfe, as ſoone as it was chriſtened, in the yeere 965. To <hi>Benedictus</hi> the 8. <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> king of <hi>Hungarie</hi> ſendeth ambaſſadours for his crowne, and confirmation of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> &amp; the Churches builded
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18839:38"/>by him. He then brought his kingdom to the obedience of the Pope: &amp; <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelfe at euery time the Pope was mentioned, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his heade, did bende his knee, that by his example he might perſwade alſo his people to the obſeruance of the Pope. <hi>Robert</hi> duke of <hi>Apulia</hi> &amp; <hi>Calabria</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> bindeth himſelfe by oth &amp; his hand writing to Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the 2. to ſend him aid whenſoeuer he ſhould neede, becauſe the Pope abſolued him, for depoſing his brothers ſonne, the right heire from the dukedom. A litle before <hi>Stephen</hi> the 9. brought the biſhop of <hi>Millaine,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time had alwaies bene free, to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe increaſes came to the popedom about the yeere 1057 A little after this, <hi>Hildebrand</hi> called <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. (that is reported to haue poiſoned ſixe Popes one after another, to make a way for himſelfe to the popedom, and was a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous coniurer &amp; Magitian) exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth &amp; ſpoileth of his empire <hi>Henry 4.</hi> &amp; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp firſt <hi>Rodulphus</hi> his ſeruant, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Henrie 5.</hi> his owne ſonne againſt him.

The crime layed to the Emperour, was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18839:39"/>as the Pope called the beſtowing of Byſhoprickes and other eccleſiaſticall liuings by the Emperour. Theſe thinges fell out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare one thouſand threeſcore and ten.</p>
            <p>Henrie the fift ſtroue ſo long with <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Calixtus</hi> the ſecond, for the beſtowing of Byſhoprickes, till at length hee was conſtrained by the thunder-bolt of excommunication, and by feare of depriuation through treaſons and conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, by his letters to graunt it to the Pope for euer: and the letters of the graunt in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Emperour being ouercome, were hanged vp in the <hi>Laterane</hi> Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> for a monument of the victorie. Through this victorie, <hi>Calixtus</hi> the ſecond, (as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) waxed bould: for thus hee decreed. <hi>A Romana Eccleſia non licere diſſentire, quia vt filius venit facere voluntate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Patris, ita opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet Chriſtianos facere volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tatem Matris Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Eccleſiae.</hi> It ſhould not be lawfull to diſſent from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe as the ſonne came to doe the will of the father: ſo muſt all Chriſtians doe the will of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of <hi>Rome.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18839:39"/>againſt <hi>Rogerius</hi> duke of <hi>Sicily</hi> for it, but it was like to haue coſt the pope well, for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was taken in the warre: yet the pope got by the helpe of <hi>Lotharius,</hi> the dukedome of <hi>Calabria</hi> from him, and gaue it for a reward to <hi>Rainold</hi> captaine of <hi>Lotharius</hi> armie, that helped him againe to his popedome. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh</hi> in the time of <hi>Eugenius</hi> receiued the faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and then became ſubiect to the pope in the yeere 1148. <hi>Liuonia</hi> had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner receiued the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith about the yeere 1158: but pope <hi>Alexander</hi> ſeizeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and by asking a biſhop of him, they are brought in bondage to him. It were long to tell how <hi>Frederike</hi> the firſt was handled of pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the third. The quarell at firſt of <hi>Adrian</hi> againſt him, was becauſe he required homage of his biſhops, and excluded his legate out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> if he came when he was not ſent for. <hi>Adrian</hi> for theſe things curſed him, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned one to faine himſelfe a ieſter, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oportunitie to kill him: but the emperour eſcaped, by leaping out at a window. Then he procured one to poiſon him by an infected ring, and that he eſcaped alſo. <hi>Alexander</hi> the third purſued him, for that he fauored <hi>Victor</hi> choſen againſt him: therefore he curſed him, made his chiefe captaine forſake him in fight
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18839:40"/>traiterouſly, and ſo was the emperour made to flee ſecretly away. And at length, when at <hi>Venice</hi> the emperours ſonne fighting raſhly againſt his fathers commandement, before his comming, was taken of the pope, by the helpe of the <hi>Venetians:</hi> hee, to redeeme his ſonne, was conſtreined to come to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> to ſubmit himſelfe to the pope. At the ſtaires in <hi>S.

He
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18839:40"/>thought that vpon the ſight of his holineſſe letters the <hi>Tartarian</hi> empire would yeeld it ſelfe vnto him. <hi>Maudauus</hi> king of <hi>Lituania,</hi> being turned to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion, falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the popes net in the yere 1255. The empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had too much experience, &amp; great feare of the euill that this <hi>beaſt</hi> might do vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt would not receiue his crowne of the pope, nor go into <hi>Italie</hi> for it. He ſaid it was ſufficient for him, that he was left empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by his anceſtors, &amp; ſo ſaluted by his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. When <hi>Frederike</hi> the firſt was going to <hi>Rome</hi> with his army, the <hi>Romans</hi> ſent meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to him, that they would not receiue him, except he came in maner of triumph. Thus they mocked the emperour, meaning, if he came ſo, to waſte him by his expences. But he perceiuing it, anſwered, that he came to get mony out of <hi>Italie,</hi> and not to leaue his owne there. <hi>Rodolph</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperor put off the fetching of his crowne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaying that the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors entring into <hi>Italy</hi> was pleaſant &amp; ſtately, but his going out was alwayes miſerable and dolefull. <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight that ordeined the firſt <hi>Iubile,</hi> &amp; kept it <hi>an. 1330,</hi> had great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with <hi>Philip</hi> king of <hi>France.</hi> In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of his heart, and to declare that he is this <hi>beaſt</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> exalting himſelfe, he writ vnto the king as foloweth. <hi>Se eſſe dominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:18839:41"/>omnium tam temporalium quàm ſpiritualium per orbem terrarum, &amp;c.</hi> That he is lord of all, as well temporall as ſpirituall thinges through out the world, &amp; that conſequently the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France</hi> ought to be receiued of him, which becauſe he had not done, he had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be depriued: but the king deſpiſed his legates, and burnt his letters in an open fire, and ſtopt the wayes of his kingdome, that none might paſſe to <hi>Rome.</hi> But the pope pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed againſt him: for he excommunicated him, gaue his kingdome to <hi>Albert</hi> the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, cauſed him to be taken by his owne houſholde ſeruants, and layd all his treaſures open to the ſpoile. <hi>Iohn</hi> the two &amp; twentieth excommunicated <hi>Ludowike</hi> the emperour, becauſe he tooke vpon him the name of the emperour without his conſent. <hi>Benedictus</hi> the twelft confirmed that excommunication againſt the emperour, and vſed the empire as his owne, placing officers in it himſelfe. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> the ſixt abſolued thoſe that did fauour <hi>Lewes,</hi> but vpon theſe conditions, that they ſhould ſweare fidelitie to the pope, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge none to be emperour, but ſuch as was confirmed by him. <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, when three popes did ſtriue together, ſhewed himſelfe ſo much a ſeruant to that ſeat, that he trauelled into <hi>France,</hi> and ſailed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18839:41"/>into <hi>England,</hi> and paſſed into <hi>Italie,</hi> and came to the councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and ſung the Goſpell, like a deacon, in great humilitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pope: the Goſpell which he did ſing, was <hi>Exijt edictum à Caeſare Auguſto.</hi> All this he did, trauelling from one king to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to make theſe beaſts agreed: ſo glad he was to pleaſe. And the greateſt care of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derike</hi> the third was, that neutrality being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> he might ſubmit himſelfe &amp; his people to the biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the yeere 1440. In this age wherein we liue, <hi>Coſmus Medices</hi> was made by the pope great duke of <hi>Ferraria,</hi> that he might trouble the world, in the yeere 1570.</p>
            <p>Thus kings haue willingly ſerued him in times paſt, and ſome haue bene brought vnto it whether they would or no, &amp; yet at length all content to doe it. In this age he hath yet ſome that fauour him, and labour to holde him vp, &amp; fight for him with all their power: the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and thoſe that depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, the duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> the duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the ſtates of <hi>Italie:</hi> and ſome fauourers he hath in <hi>France.</hi> The beaſt is now much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then he was, and it is maruell that there are any found in this land, or els where, that make ſo great account of his fauour.</p>
            <p>I haue ſhewed vnto you, how this beaſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18839:42"/>hath had kings his aſſiſtants, and as it were, his ſeruants: which neuer came to paſſe in any gouernment in the world, that kings not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by armes, but ſcarſely threatened by words, ſo many, and ſo willingly, ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to one, &amp; be content to holde their crownes of him, and in all things to be at his commandement. They receiued his decrees, they forſooke their kingdomes, they waged warre againſt one another, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned a great part of their ſubiects, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their land to be tributarie, they would attempt to winne the Holy land, as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, with hazzard of their liues, and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paines, and exceeding great expences, and all at his commandement. When was there any power in the world that coulde worke this, &amp; bring them thus to obedience? The emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> had kings vnder them, which remained kings: but they were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by battell, few voluntarily did yeelde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. They fought oft for <hi>Spaine,</hi> for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frike,</hi> for <hi>Greece,</hi> for <hi>Egypt,</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> for <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> &amp; for euery part of <hi>Italie</hi> it ſelfe, before they could obteine it: but the pope had all the Weſt part ſubiect to him, and ſcarſe euer fought for any: by the ſword he ſubdued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt none of them vnto him: nay he neuer fought for any, except it were for ſome ſmall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18839:42"/>dukedome or citie of <hi>Italie,</hi> which he counted <hi>Peters</hi> patrimonie. Is not this plainely that which the Angel ſaith to <hi>Iohn: Theſe haue one minde, &amp; ſhall giue their power to the beaſt?</hi> And againe, <hi>God hath put in their hearts, to fulfill his will, and to doe with one conſent, for to giue their kingdome to the beaſt, vntill the words of God be fulfilled.</hi> They ſhall giue it, they ſhall not be conquered &amp; conſtreined by his power vnto it. Thus much of the kings that aſſiſt the beaſt.</p>
            <p>After the kings aſſiſting <hi>the beaſt,</hi> there are placed alſo armies vnder him. Not one army, but many armies are leuied for his defence. They boaſt much of multitude and number. And the Holy ghoſt giueth vnto them the greateſt number, as a ſure marke of <hi>the beast.</hi> This cauſe ſtandeth not by number, but by weight of voices. If number ſhould carie the matter of religion, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould haue the truth of it on their ſide. There is more dirt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> golde, moe ſtones then pearles, more chaffe then good corne, and ſo moe that holde on ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition then on trueth. Our Sauiour ſaith: <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen:</hi> and <hi>narrow is the way that leadeth to life, &amp; few there be that find it: but broad is the way that leadeth to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; many there be that folow it.</hi> Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore boaſt of the greater number, yea &amp; nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber not naked, but armed, furniſhed &amp; inſtructed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18839:43"/>to fight. We grant it them. It was theirs much more then it is, and yet is theirs more then (I hope) it will be heereafter. The holy ghoſt hath giuen them the multitude for a time. A great number was ſignified to adhaere to <hi>the beaſt,</hi> when it is ſaid, <hi>He cauſed the earth and them that dwell therein, to worſhip the firſt beast.</hi> And againe, <hi>He deceiued them that dwell on the earth.</hi> And yet more, <hi>He cauſed that as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as woulde not worſhip the image of the beast, ſhould be killed.</hi> And further, <hi>He made all, both ſmall and great, rich and poore, free and bond, to receiue a marke in their right hand, or in their forehead, and that no man might buy nor ſell, but he that had the marke, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name.</hi> Thus in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter, the greater number is ſhewed to appertaine vnto <hi>the beaſt.</hi> In the ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter it is called <hi>the great whore, the great citie:</hi> and it is ſaid moreouer, <hi>The waters which thou ſaweſt where the whore ſitteth, are peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and multitudes, and nations and tongues.</hi> And to omit many other places, heere at laſt, it is ſaid, <hi>I ſaw the beaſt and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to fight.</hi> Should we then doubt, whether their ſide be the ſide of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> becauſe their fauourers are many? Nay, thereby we are made the more certaine of it.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:18839:43"/>
            <p>Another note they haue, by which they thinke to further their part, which is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. It is a good token of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> diſciples, if they loue one another: but to conſent, and to conſpire together, is not proper to the good, but agreeth to the wicked alſo. The heathen agreed all in their generall ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no falling out greatly among them for it. The <hi>Turks</hi> haue but two parts or ſects, and ech ſect agreeth and holdeth ſtrait toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> agreed to make the Golden calfe: the tenne tribes conſented to the ſetting vp of the calues in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel.</hi> And what maruell then, if all the Weſt parts of the world haue conſented together to worſhip and maintaine the <hi>Romiſh beast? Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>the tenne kings haue one minde, and ſhall giue their power and authoritie to the beast.</hi> And heere it is ſaid: <hi>Their armies were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together to fight.</hi> They were not diſperſed, and ſcattered, but gathered together in one purpoſe, and in one meaning, to fight againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his armie.</p>
            <p>The common ſort of Papiſtes ſeeme to care for no point elſe in religion, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie this. The <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and the ignorant <hi>Engliſh</hi> papiſts ſeeke ſcarſe any further into the cauſe, but onely ſtand vpon that head and branch, that the Holy
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18839:44"/>ghoſt hath ſet downe, that is to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his armie. As for all other pointes of religion, it is their greateſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion not to ſearch into religion. Thus the Holy ghoſt in two wordes ſetteth downe much of that whereupon they ſtand, and which in our dayes we ſee fulfilled. Theſe are the generall notes of their armies gathered out of theſe words.</p>
            <p>In that there are armies named, we may well gather that they are of moe kindes then one. They themſelues diuide their whole multitude into the Spiritualtie and Laitie. So by their owne diuiſion they haue two kindes of armies, one of great learned men, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, diuines, and other profeſſours of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and another of captaines and ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and armed men, and generallie the reſt of the people. Such an armie as the firſt is, eſpecially of prieſtes,
<note place="margin">Lib. 4. epiſt. 38.</note> 
               <hi>Gregorius Magnus</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth vnto <hi>Antichriſt. Rex ſuperbiae propè est, &amp; quod dici quoque nefas est, ſacerdotum ei praeparatur exercitus.</hi> The king of pride is neere at hand, and that which is an heinous thing to ſpeake, an armie of prieſts is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him. And this he ſpake agreeable to this reuelation. For <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, <hi>I ſaw three vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpirites like frogges come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beaſt,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18839:44"/>and out of the mouth of the falſe prophet.</hi> For they are ſpirites of deuils, working miracles, to goe vnto the kinges of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of that great day of God almightie. Yea, and their indeuour was not in vaine, for they did gather them together.</p>
            <p>In this chapter it is ſayd: <hi>The beast was taken, and with him the falſe Prophet that wrought miracles before him, whereby hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them that receiued the beaſtes marke.</hi> Theſe <hi>ſpirits,</hi> this <hi>falſe prophet,</hi> are ſet downe to note their firſt and moſt dangerous kinde of armie. They call themſelues the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie, and this ſcripture calleth them <hi>ſpirits:</hi> How could it come neerer? The other name of <hi>falſe prophets,</hi> is taken from the ſtate of the Olde Teſtament: for as then falſe prophets alwayes oppoſed themſelues againſt the true prophets, ſo now their prieſts and monkes, and the reſt of their religious rabble, againſt the true preachers of the Goſpell. But why doeth hee terme them <hi>the falſe prophet,</hi> and not falſe prophets, when it is euident that they are many? Is it for their conſent in this matter of gaineſaying? or is it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that in euery age, and for ech pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of lawe and diuinitie, they haue one eſpecially, vpon whoſe wit and learning
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18839:45"/>they all depend: for their law, <hi>Gratian:</hi> for their diuinitie, <hi>Lumbard:</hi> after him in one age, <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and againſt <hi>Luther, Eckius:</hi> in this time, <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> for ſo in ech age they ſeeme to ſucke their learning, and all their arguments, and quiddities from the breaſt, of ſome one aboue all the reſt. But for what cauſe ſoeuer it is termed in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, falſe prophets pertaine to the ſtate ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, and they are the greateſt doers in theſe warres.</p>
            <p>Nowe conſider all the ſtates in the world beſides, and ſee where there is authoritie, yea, or almoſt any dealing for warre matters, put in the hands of them to whome the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion directlie are committed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all thoſe that profeſſe the Goſpell in all kingdomes of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> there is ſcarſe any one in a kingdome admitted to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell about thoſe thinges, much leſſe doe they contriue warres, and ſtirre them vp, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt intermeddle in them. Amongſt the <hi>Turkes</hi> they haue not to deale in it: their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons are not the procurers of their warres, by running from one prince to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They ſhake a ſpeare, and vſe ſome wordes in their owne temple, to ſtirre vp the people to fight againſt <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they contriue not the warres. In the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18839:45"/>
               <hi>Tartarian</hi> gouernment, the affaires of the warres are not in ſuch mens hands. So that in this poynt the Papiſts onely are fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to this propheſie, and the <hi>Turkes</hi> come next vnto them, but yet they are but babes to them in this exerciſe. Let the name of the falſe prophet be common to <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> and his prieſtes, with the Popiſh clergie, but the <hi>three vncleane ſpirites like frogges, that came out of the mouth of the beast,</hi> can be no other but the Popiſh ſpiritualtie: for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the number, and the qualitie, and the compariſon, and the worke, and effect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to none other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>beaſt</hi> is ſaid to be their <hi>father:</hi> for the pope did beget and nouriſh all that ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as it ſtandeth, and is Popiſh: for by his commandement they had their beginning, and ſtill haue their being, and therefore it is ſayd, that theſe <hi>ſpirites come out of his mouth.</hi> There was no order among them, of cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles, biſhops, prieſts, of monks, and friers, but they were all in number and forme by his appoyntment and confirmation. They vſed no ceremonie but it was ordeined by him. Their priuileges and exemptions from the ſecular power were all granted by him. Their liuing and maintenance was all held of him: and to him in token thereof the payed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18839:46"/>the firſt fruites of their liuinges. Hee inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the biſhops, and by his authoritie the biſhop made all the reſt: ſo they <hi>came out of the mouth of the beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were long; in particular, to prooue all theſe thinges. The qualitie of vncleanneſſe and filthineſſe is praedominant in them: for they are vncleane in their ſoules, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſhed in the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor with the pure water of Gods word. And they are vncleane in their bodyes; for the moſt part of their monkes and friers tooke a pride in their ſlouenlineſſe. And they are vncleane in their actions, as being defiled with adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Sodomiticall ſinne, becauſe they condemned marriage. They are aptly alſo reduced to the number of three: for their biſhops and prieſtes, and ſuch as haue the actions of all their religious matters, make one order: and their friers and monkes, and ſcholaſticall ſtudents, which are ſequeſtred from action, and placed as it were in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, make another order: and their canoniſts and lawyers, with their other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, make their third order.</p>
            <p>All theſe together make the beaſts ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall armie. And theſe are fitly compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to frogges: for as frogges lie in the mudde, ſo theſe tumble in worldly things and humane
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18839:46"/>ſpeculations, and can not lift vp their mindes to that which is heauenly. And as frogges haue but one tune, ſo they ſing onely obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the pope: and as frogges cry moſt fiercelie about the time of raine and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, ſo theſe when they come crying ouer the ſea vnto vs, alwayes giue a moſt ſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that there is a tempeſt comming. Theſe frogs delight not by any meanes with calme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and quietneſſe, their delight is to haue the world &amp; all kingdomes troubled. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their worke is this, to runne from one prince to another, from one noble man to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, from this gentleman to that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to perſuade them to warre. Thus is their ſpirituall armie deſcribed.</p>
            <p>To ſet forth how they fight with ſcriptures and fathers wreſted from their true meaning, with decrees of councels of their owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, with promiſes of great ſucceſſe and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, with lyes and ſlanders againſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and preachers, and all profeſſours of the Goſpell, with conſpiracies and treaſons, and murthers, and poyſoning of great perſons, with contributions of money, &amp; all that they can make to the maintenance of theſe warres, with indulgences and pardons from all ſinnes paſt &amp; to come, with incantations, coniurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; inchantments, for they are <hi>the ſpirits of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18839:47"/>deuils:</hi> with promiſe of heauen it ſelfe to all that take ſword in hand for them, it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. Our experience in this age teacheth vs enough, &amp; too much (if it ſo pleaſed God) that we cannot be ignorant of their moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilliſh and deſperate maner of fighting. Thus much of their ſpirituall armie, and of their fight.</p>
            <p>They haue alſo other armies of warlike ſouldiers and captaines. The pope neuer yet attempted any matter ſo wicked againſt any prince, or for his owne eſtate, but he had kings and dukes, and noble men that woulde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be readie at his commandement to fight in his quarell: and if other things failed, yet <hi>Peters</hi> patrimonie in <hi>Italie</hi> is ſo great, and the ſummes that haue and do come in by firſt fruits, &amp; other infinite taxes, both of his cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and laitie, that it was eaſie for him to raiſe an armie at any time in this later age. One while <hi>Charles</hi> the French emperor fought for him, another while <hi>Henry</hi> the third emperour of <hi>Germanie.</hi> Sometime he hath them of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> at his commandement, as in times paſt the dukes of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and almoſt any other. The king of <hi>Sicilie</hi> was euer as his ſeruant. <hi>France</hi> hath fought for him againſt the emperour, and againſt <hi>England,</hi> &amp; againſt the <hi>Italians,</hi> and againſt one pope for another
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18839:47"/>Pope. <hi>England</hi> hath not wanted in this kinde of ſeruice for him. Our kings he hath ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> againſt vs, and our nobles againſt our owne princes, both of old time, and of late. And this thing ſtill he doth attempt. God confound his enterpriſes in this behalfe, as hee hath done hitherto in her Maieſties reigne. Now he hath but fewe in compariſon, that wil take armes at his deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> not in any regard of his Religion, but in hope of a Monarchie vnder his title, hath ſtepped forth as his champion in this age, to fight his warres for him. By him the armies are renewed and ſupplied in the Lowe countries: by him the warres are holden vp in <hi>France:</hi> through his meanes, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua</hi> hath bin beſieged: and he hath ſent his inuincible nauie to ſubdue vs: but God bee thanked, that hath drowned it in the ſeas. We may not thinke, that either <hi>the beaſt</hi> or his champion will ſo giue ouer. For it is againſt the nature of the enemies of Gods people to deſiſt, although they ſee Gods hand neuer ſo manifeſtly againſt them. Not ten plagues will keepe <hi>Pharao</hi> from purſuing the <hi>Iſraelits.</hi> Not the Angel deſtroying an hundred and foureſcore thouſand in one night, will feare the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> but they will come againſt <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> It is fatall to <hi>the beaſt</hi> to bid battell
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18839:48"/>ſo long, till he procure his owne ruine, and the fall of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would hold him vp. They will fight againe: <hi>The frogs, theſe vncleane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> that come ouer to vs, are a moſt ſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that we muſt looke for a tempeſt. It will come moſt certainely: but when it will fall we are not certaine. God turne it vpon their owne heads when ſo euer it commeth, as he did that which is paſt.</p>
            <p>I haue ſpoken longer then I thought I ſhould, of the firſt part touching <hi>the beaſt</hi> and <hi>his kings,</hi> and <hi>their armies.</hi> We can not ſpeake too much againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that neuer thinke they do ynough againſt vs. It is good for vs to haue our mindes armed againſt them, and to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that they are not only enemies to vs, but vnto God, and <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> and his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the ſaluation of his people. God graunt to our Queenes maieſtie, and all our nobilitie, and the whole people, his ſpirit, and grace, againſt the poyſon of their doctrine, and his mightie defence againſt all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt terrors and ſecret conſpiracies. This the God of all might and comfort, graunt vnto vs through <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: To whome with the Father, and the holy ghoſt, three perſons and one God, be all honour, and glory, world without ende <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>The ſecond Sermon vpon <hi>Apoc. cap.</hi> 19. <hi>verſe</hi> 19.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Deuided this verſe into two parts. The one is of thoſe that doe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne: the other of thoſe that doe defend. I haue ſpoken alreadie of them that giue the onſet. They were <hi>the beaſt, the kings of the earth, and their armies.</hi> I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>the beaſt</hi> is the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> the <hi>kings of the earth</hi> are they that yeelde obedience to him: <hi>their armies</hi> are firſt the ſpiritual and learned ſorte, that ſtriue to maintaine the popedome by witte &amp; learning: and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the warriers and other people, that by ſword and force do fight for him. Now it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, to ſpeake of the parties y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and doe defend themſelues. <hi>They fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him that ſitteth on the horſe, &amp; againſt his armie.</hi> For <hi>armie,</hi> ſome tranſlations reade <hi>ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:</hi> But it doth not ſo well aunſwere to the Greeke. The word ſignifieth an armie preſſed forth, and ſet in order to battel. <hi>He that rideth on the horſe,</hi> is vnderſtoode to bee <hi>Chriſt.</hi> His <hi>armie</hi> are they that beleeue his goſpel &amp; obey it. Theſe are aſſalted &amp; oppugned by <hi>the beaſt</hi> &amp; <hi>his armies.</hi> Two thinges muſt bee obſerued in this onſet made againſt Chriſt and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18839:49"/>by the enemies. Firſt, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his people haue the right and lawfull poſſeſſion of the Church and the trueth, of heauen, of earth, and of all things, and that they would thruſt both <hi>Christ</hi> and his, out of this poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Christ</hi> ſayeth of himſelfe: <hi>All power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto me in heauen and in earth,</hi> and his people are made the heires of the world: for to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaid, <hi>all things are yours:</hi> and againe: <hi>He that ouer commeth ſhall inherite all.</hi> The <hi>beaſt</hi> then, and <hi>his armies,</hi> labour to thruſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> &amp; his armie out of all: Which they could not doe, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his people had not the right and poſſeſſion of all. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſuffered them to beſiege him, and his people, and to thruſt them into verie great ſtraites for a ſeaſon. For they haue bene conſtrained <hi>to flie into the wildernes</hi> and there to ly hid. But now <hi>Christ</hi> will vp on <hi>the white horſe</hi> and raiſe the ſiege, and bee ſhut vp ſo ſtraite no longer. That is, the firſt thing that followeth of this, that <hi>the beaſt</hi> is he that maketh the aſſault.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that followeth thereof is this: that the enemies euer ſeeke their owne deſtruction, or els it would not come vpon them. It ſhould ſeeme reaſon, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his people ſhould ſet vpon <hi>the beast</hi> &amp; <hi>his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> For is it meete that they, holding that which belongeth vnto <hi>Chriſt</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, ſhould
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18839:49"/>not be ſuffered to liue and to enioye it? But <hi>Chriſt</hi> dealeth not ſo: he ſuffereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quietly to withdrawe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from him, and letteth their fury increaſe, till they go about to roote him and his people from among them. He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them ſcope to ſhewe their malice. Now when Gods people ſeeme ſtrangelieſt aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and are in danger of greateſt bondage, then <hi>is their deliuerance neere at hand.</hi> A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe was made of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dealing of <hi>Pharao</hi> with the <hi>Iſraelities, Quando duplicantur lateres, tum venit Moſes:</hi> When the brickes are dubled, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Moſes commeth. When the enemies ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are greateſt and beſt furniſhed, then are they moſt neere their ouerthrow. It is a thing worthie to be marked, how <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſtill gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the onſet, and all his attempts for the moſt part, haue turned to his loſſe. This much of <hi>the beaſt</hi> &amp; his aſſaulting, and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his being aſſaulted, and defending the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</p>
            <p>It followeth to ſhew what it meaneth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is deſcribed here by riding <hi>vpon a horſe.</hi> The horſe that he ſitteth vpon, is ſaid to be a <hi>white horſe.</hi> And that it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rideth vpon him, there can be no doubt. For the diſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that goeth before can agree to none other. Thus <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith of him: <hi>I ſawe heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> open, and behold, a white horſe, and he that ſate vpon him was called faithful and true: and he iudgeth and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18839:50"/>fighteth righteouſly, &amp; his eyes were as a flame of fire, &amp; on his head were many crownes, &amp; he had a name written that no man knew but himſelfe, &amp; he was clothed in a garment dipt in blood, and his name is called the word of God, and out of his mouth went aſharpe ſword, that with it he ſhould ſmite the heathen. For he ſhal rule them with a rod of yron: for he it is that treadeth the wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe of the fiercenes &amp; wrath of almightie God.</hi> All theſe thinges agree to <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone. He is faithfull and true in his promiſes, hee iudgeth &amp; fighteth righteouſly, in puniſhing the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, &amp; defending his people, while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in obedience to him: his eyes are as fire, he ſeeth &amp; ſearcheth all things, yea the hearts of men. He reigneth ouer all, and hath obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many crownes by many victories, and kings and princes ſubdued vnto him: his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was dipt in blood to redeeme vs, and he hath dipt it againe, &amp; doth now dayly in the ſlaughter of his enemies: his name &amp; eſſence is ſuch as none knoweth but God, that is, himſelfe. And hee is the word of God which <hi>was in the beginning:</hi> which is, <hi>God by whome all thinges were made.</hi> Out of his mouth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſharpe ſword of Gods iuſt decree, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth the enemies: &amp; laſt of all he executeth gods vengeance vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and as it were preſſeth them in the winepreſſe of his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18839:50"/>wrath. <hi>Chriſt</hi> therefore is vnderſtood by him that ſitteth on the horſe.</p>
            <p>But why is <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to ſit vpon a horſe, &amp; that a white horſe? What meaneth this horſe? It is well knowen to all men, that the horſe is a warlike beaſt, &amp; as it were made for warre. He is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to carry, &amp; bold to come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the face of the enemie: he is ſwift to make ſpeede, &amp; fit to be turned this way &amp; that way. So he was apointed to warre. But for prieſtly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and perſons, he was not thought meete: Therefore the prieſts of <hi>Egypt</hi> might not ride vpon a horſe. It was thought among them a thing prophane. Neither might ſome of the heathen <hi>Romane Flamines</hi> ſo much as touch a horſe. And euen now, it is thought an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely thing for the Pope to bee ſeene to ride vpon a horſe within the citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> except onely vpon one ſolemne day in the yeare, when he rideth to the <hi>Laterane,</hi> and all his prelates with him vpon white horſes. For otherwiſe in <hi>Rome</hi> he is caryed vpon mens ſhoulders for the moſt part. Once a yeere he would like Chriſt, ride vpon a white horſe: yet hee neuer rideth on the horſe whereon <hi>Chriſt</hi> rideth, he can not abide y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> white horſe.</p>
            <p>What then is this white horſe? Some are of opinion, that the white horſe is ſet as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the laſt iudgement, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:18839:51"/>is here deſcribed to come vpon a white horſe to iudge the world. In ſuch a ſenſe a <hi>white cloude</hi> is giuen to him wherein he ſhall come. But it may ſeeme rather, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription pertaineth not to the laſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: Firſt, becauſe in iudgement hee is ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>to ſit vpon a throne,</hi> as in the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in <hi>Daniel.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>We ſhal all appeare before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt.</hi> Now a <hi>throne,</hi> or a <hi>ſeate,</hi> and a <hi>horſe,</hi> haue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſignification: For the one pertaineth to quietnes, the other to motion. This deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſetteth forth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as mouing &amp; going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and not as reſting and ending all. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the ſpace of time, that is betweene this viage wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> thus rideth, and the iudgement, will not ſuffer this to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of the laſt iudgement. For as ſome thinke, there ſhalbe after this battel &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of the Beaſt here mentioned, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeres, or a great long ſpace before the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or the end of al. Becauſe after this, <hi>Iohn</hi> reporteth that he did <hi>ſee Satan bound a thouſand yeres, and then let looſe for a ſeaſon.</hi> I ſpeake not of the <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> which imagined a thouſand yeeres of happie life here on earth, after the reſurrection. But <hi>Morelius</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth there may be a thouſand yeeres, or a long time before the laſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t after this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18839:51"/>ouerthrowe of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> for this ſhould not be his finall ouerthrowe, but that he ſhould renewe his ſtrength ſomewhat againe, and fight yet againſt the ſaintes of God, which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeemeth to meane, when he ſaith in the next Chapter, that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog, whoſe number was as the ſande of the ſea, were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and compaſſed the beloued citie, &amp; fire came downe from heauen to conſume them.</hi> Theſe and other things, which I will nowe recite, make many thinke, that <hi>the white horſe</hi> here ſpoken of, pertaineth not to the laſt iudgement.</p>
            <p>What then may this white horſe be? It is the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> that being publiſhed and made knowne to the world, carieth <hi>Christ</hi> abroad: according to it hee ouercommeth <hi>the beast.</hi> This runneth ſwiftly, this carieth him from place to place, vpon this he rideth as <hi>vpon the winges of the winde.</hi> For he is deſcribed here by thoſe thinges which yet pertaine to the publiſhing of his name among men, to the furtherance of his knowledge, and vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of his enemies, and enlarging of his Church vpon earth. To this it appertaineth that he is ſaid <hi>to be faithfull and true in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to his elect; that hee iudgeth and fighteth righteouſly for his people, in a righteous cauſe,</hi> and while they embrace righteouſnes, that he hath many crownes vpon his head, kings
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18839:52"/>yeelding their crownes to him, which before they ſubmitted to the Pope: that he is called <hi>the word of God,</hi> as yet reuealing his ſecrete counſell: that his garment is dipt in blood, making daily great ſlaughters of his enemies, and that a ſharpe ſword commeth out of his mouth, euen his iuſt decree againſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. In the ſixt Chapter, the white horſe hath receaued the like interpretation of the moſt Interpreters. Thus <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayeth: <hi>I behelde, and loe there was a white horſe, and he that ſate on him had a bowe, and a crowne was giuen vnto him, and hee went foorth conquering, that hee might ouercome.</hi> There by the white horſe is meant the Goſpell: with the bowe hee ſhot the arrowes of his worde, his threatnings and grieuous iudgements, and wounded his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. He went in the firſt age after his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, conquering and conuerting the world to himſelfe, and ſtill had more and more to conquer, becauſe hee neuer wanted enemies. And nowe towards the ende hee mounteth on <hi>the white horſe,</hi> and againe rideth gloriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly in the ſight of his people.</p>
            <p>This horſe (that is, his Goſpell) is ſaide to be <hi>white.</hi> Firſt, becauſe without all vaile or couer it ſheweth foorth the full purpoſe of Gods good will vnto men, for by it wee ſee God as in a glaſſe, and are made to knowe his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18839:52"/>fauour moſt clearely. Secondly, becauſe it teacheth and bringeth to vs iuſtification and forgiuenes of ſinnes, which being laid holde on by faith, maketh vs white in the ſight of God. Thirdly, becauſe it doth commend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs an innocent &amp; a pure life, all the ſtaines and blacknes of ſinne being waſhed foorth. And laſt of all, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> by it ſheweth himſelfe victorious &amp; triumphant: for a white horſe was vſed in triumph. Thus is <hi>Chriſt</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, by <hi>riding vpon a white horſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The beaſt</hi> and his <hi>kings,</hi> and <hi>their armies,</hi> fight againſt him while he is thus ſitting on the white horſe. They cannot fight againſt him as he is in heauen, they cannot reach to his perſon there. Neither ſhall they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minde to fight againſt him, as he ſitteth or commeth to iudgement, but their fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes being then baniſhed, they ſhall tremble at his preſence. But as he ſitteth on the white horſe, as hee is made knowen to the world in his Goſpell, by which hee maketh vs white, forgiuing our ſinnes, and chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our liues, ſo <hi>the beast</hi> fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. It will bee too late to fight, when he commeth in iudgement: Then the beaſt himſelfe ſhall haue no courage to fight. But nowe the meaneſt ſouldier, the baſeſt Seminarye that is vnder the beaſte,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18839:53"/>euery buſie ſchiſmatike will encounter him and his whole armie, while hee <hi>ſitteth on the white horſe.</hi> Therefore in theſe daies they are ſo ſawcie with him and his horſe, and all his armie.</p>
            <p>Of this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> onely is captaine and generall on the one ſide, it followeth that they which will be ſaued, muſt cleaue to him alone for their ſaluation. Euery thing that is againſt him, or ſeemeth to ſteppe into his place, muſt be remooued. The Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, adoration of images, inuocation of ſaintes, confidence in workes, all theſe muſt be reiected, and wee muſt cleaue onely to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for ſaluation. His people are known by hauing him to be their leader, and not by a Pope, or a city, or any one earthly power ruling ouer them. Againe it is to be concluded, that ſeeing <hi>Chriſt</hi> commeth no way to his Church, but ſitting vpon the white horſe, and that horſe is his Goſpell, therefore all men that will receaue him and his benefites, muſt ſubmit themſelues to be taught by his word, and ſeeke to knowe his Goſpell: he that receaueth not his word, can not receaue him.</p>
            <p>Now would it ſeeme meete to ſhew (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel is this white horſe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> doeth ſit on) whether hee commeth vnto vs
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18839:53"/>vpon it being read, or being preached? and whether the learned and preaching miniſters onely bee this white horſe, or alſo the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and readers may be accounted ſuch as beare forth <hi>Chriſt</hi> vnto his people? I thinke <hi>Chriſt</hi> commeth by the one and by the other, and each of them doeth beare him foorth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he doeth ride more gloriouſly &amp; ſwiftly in the ſound of learned preaching. But of this point I ſhall ſpeake ſomewhat in the next part. Thus much ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken of him which ſitteth on the horſe, which is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our king and onely captaine.</p>
            <p>The next and laſt generall head to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is the armie of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The beaſt and his armies fight againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his armie. The Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called by many names, but here in the matter and time of warre, it is called an armie. Likewiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth of it, <hi>that it is terrible as an armie with banners. Paul</hi> vſing the ſame Metaphore, will haue vs <hi>put on the armour of light,</hi> and ſaieth, that <hi>the weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but mightie through God to caſt downe holdes,</hi> and willeth vs to <hi>put vpon vs the whole armour of God, that we may be able to ſtand againſt the aſſaults of the deuill:</hi> and of himſelfe he witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that <hi>he had fought a good fight, and finiſhed his courſe.</hi> So that there is a warre, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18839:54"/>and weapons, and fighting, that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to gods people, and they altogether make an armie.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> is an excellent and noble band of this armie. Wee are <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſouldiers, we beare his colours, he rideth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, and among vs vpon the white horſe, he is our captaine, and we are his armie. Two kinds of enemies we haue that labour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; the world, that we are not <hi>Christs</hi> armie, the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Barrowiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt the Papiſts we haue maintained, that the ſound teaching of the word of God, and the lawfull adminiſtration of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are the moſt ſure enſignes, whereby his armie is knowen: and that we haue theſe among vs, and they are effectuall in vs. When we allege that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith: <hi>My ſheepe heare my voyce, and a ſtrangers voyce they will not heare:</hi> That which <hi>Eſaie</hi> hath: <hi>To the lawe, and to the testimonie, if they anſwere not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this, it is becauſe there is no light in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> When we allege theſe, and the like places: we obtaine, that the true and ſound ſetting forth of the worde of God, is a moſt certaine ſigne and note of the Church. That which <hi>Paul</hi> hath: <hi>If any man preach another goſpel, let him be accurſed.</hi> That which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith: <hi>He that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18839:54"/>and if any man bring not the doctrine of Christ, receaue him not:</hi> declareth, that a falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the goſpel and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> deſtroyeth the Church: eſpecially, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> errour be in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which is our iuſtification by faith in Chriſt, and all thoſe things which doe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily depend vpon it. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>Other foundation can no man lay, then that which is layed, euen Ieſus Christ:</hi> And againe, <hi>Ye are built vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Ieſus Christ himſelfe being the chiefe corner ſtone.</hi> For this cauſe, <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo carefully and oft, ſtand vpon the clearing of this article of our iuſtification by faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in ſo manie of his Epiſtles. The true doctrine of the Goſpel, is thus founde to be the note, yea, and ſeede of the Church. That the right and lawfull adminiſtration of the Sacraments pertaineth to the deſcription, and declaration of the Church, we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily confirme.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour ioyneth the Sacraments to the worde: <hi>Goe teach all nations, baptizing them.</hi> The Apoſtle doeth the like, when hee ſayeth: <hi>Chriſt hath clenſed his Church, by the waſhing of water through the worde.</hi> And of the other Sacrament, it is ſayde: <hi>Doe this in remembraunce of mee.</hi> And, <hi>drinke yee all of this.</hi> And the firſt Church
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18839:55"/>gathered together after <hi>Christes</hi> aſcenſion, is thus deſcribed: <hi>They that gladly receaued his worde, were baptized, and the ſame day there were added to the Church about three thouſand ſoules, and they continued in the Apoſtles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread and praiers.</hi> Theſe things by the benefite of God we haue, the trueth of the Goſpell, and the whole new and olde Teſtament in all points of ſubſtance of doctrine truly taught, and ſet footh in this lande: the ſacraments alſo are rightly adminiſtred. Wherefore we haue the true notes of the Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the true notes of the Church, ſuch notes as are alſo cauſes of it: for the word and ſacraments doe beget and nouriſh faith, by which we are vnited to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as to the heade. Many other things agree to the Church, as good workes, mutuall loue, true repentance, ſhunning of idolatrie, a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of the name of God, and the like. But theſe are partes and effects and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the former, and concurre together with them: for the word taught muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be fruitfull, and ſo the ſacraments to worke in mens ſoules, and both to be of power, or els they are no longer tokens to vs that wee are of the Church of God. Theſe things thus vnderſtood, are the true and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18839:55"/>markes, whereby he that hath ſpirituall eyes, may ſee the Church of God. Theſe, by the ſpeciall working of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> we yet retaine in ſuch ſorte, as they bring foorth fruite in mens hearts and liues. God grant they may continue with vs, and be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to worke amendment in all. As for thoſe marks, wherby the Papiſts would haue the Church to be diſcerned, they are deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they can not point it out. <hi>Antiquitie</hi> hath erred, <hi>Vniuerſalitie</hi> hath bin corrupted, <hi>Vnitie</hi> may be in falſhood, <hi>Succeſſion</hi> in place may be without <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> in trueth: their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marks are of like nature. The worde and Sacraments rightly ſet forth and receaued, and bringing forth fruite, can neuer deceaue vs, but bring vs directly to the true Church of <hi>Ieſus Christ.</hi> But what ſhal we ſay to them that make diſcipline a neceſſarie marke of the Church: becauſe our Sauiour ſaith: <hi>Baptize them, teaching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to obſerue whatſoeuer I haue commaunded you?</hi> The obſeruation that our Sauiour ſpeaketh of, is not of ſome certaine forme of outward gouernement, but general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of obedience to faith, to loue, and to the whole lawe and Goſpell. As for that <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> by <hi>Elders</hi> in euery pariſh, it will not be found in thoſe wordes of <hi>Christ.</hi> The Church can not well ſtand without all eccleſiaſticall
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18839:56"/>gouernement. Yet it ſeemeth it did ſo ſtand in the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon:</hi> but without that forme it may very well ſtand and floriſh, and ſo hath done in this and former ages in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places. Wherefore the worde and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments remaine as the markes in generall, whereby the Church may be diſcerned.</p>
            <p>But the Barrowiſts, and ſuch of whome they haue learned their principles, deſcend into a more ſpeciall and neere deſcription of the Church. The worde and Sacramentes are not ſuch notes with them, as can point out a Church. What then is the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their account? diuerſe of them haue gone about to deſcribe it, but one eſpecially would ſeeme to doe it moſt fully: therefore he deſcribeth it in theſe wordes at large. <hi>The true planted, and rightly establiſhed Church of Christ, is a companie of faithful people, ſeparated from the heathen of the land, gathered in the name of Christ, whome they truely worſhip, and readily obey, as their onely king, prieſt, and prophet, ioyned together as members of one bodie, ordered and gouerned by ſuch officers and lawes, as Chriſt in his laſt will and teſtament hath thereunto ordained, all, and each of them, ſtanding in and for their Chriſtian libertie, to practiſe whatſoeuer God hath commanded, and is reuealed to them in his holy worde, executing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18839:56"/>the Lordes iudgementes against all tranſgreſſion and diſobedience, which ariſeth amongſt them, and cutting it off accordingly, by the power which their Lord and king Chriſt Ieſus hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them.</hi> This is the <hi>Church,</hi> this is the armie of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their account: and ſuch they will not acknowledge vs to be.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>pariſhes</hi> which they call <hi>periſhes,</hi> they examine by all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parts of this deſcription, and wil not allowe to any pariſh, any one of theſe thinges. Ten partes are found in it: Let vs ſee how they examine our Churches by them.</p>
            <p>Firſt they ſay, the Church <hi>conſiſteth of a faithfull people.</hi> None are accounted of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee of the Church, but ſuch as are regenerate, &amp; haue the ſpirit, and are indued with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and haue receaued the gift of a ſauing faith. But it is certaine, that many are in the viſible church, that haue not theſe things. For firſt <hi>the kingdome of God is like a net that gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth together good &amp; bad:</hi> the bad are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, neither haue theſe things by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And as many followed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he walked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth &amp; were his diſciples, which followed not for regeneration, but for that he fed their bodies: ſo is it in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church now. And what ſhal we ſay of the tares y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>to be ſuffered til the harueſt, leaſt the wheate be plucked vp with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi> They are not only hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18839:57"/>which are like the good, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tares are not like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wheate, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> open wicked &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: which, if the Church would goe about to roote out from among them, they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the whole, as by experience hath oft bin feene. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth: <hi>All men haue not faith:</hi> he ſpeaketh not onely of them that are without, but euen of them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church. And to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> hee ſayth: <hi>Some haue not the knowledge of God, I ſpeake this to your ſhame.</hi> Wherefore, euen in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> (the people whereof are called faithfull and Saintes) there were ſome that had no knowledge of God. And why may not that befall the Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which befell the <hi>Iſraelites?</hi> Vnto vs was the Goſpell preached, as vnto them: but the worde that they heard, profited not them, becauſe it was not mixed with faith in thoſe that heard it. As wee are like them in hearing, ſo why may not ſome among vs be like them in not beleeuing? And yet as they were, ſo may we be reckoned of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde Church. They ſee that the Church in the time of the Prophets, had many, which were neither regenerate, nor faithfull, ſuch as had neither the ſpirrte nor knowledge. But they would make vs differ from them, in a ſtraiter couenant of ſeparation. For they ſay,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18839:57"/>the carnal propagation from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and outward circumciſion, was inough to keepe them in the Church: but nothing keepeth vs in it that is outward, not baptiſme, nor any outwarde thing, but onely grace, and faith, and the ſpirite: If any man haue not theſe, and be not ſo eſteemed, hee is not to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſo much as of the viſible Church. And this they grounde of the practiſe of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which as they ſaye, ſeparated none from their Synagogues for ſinne. But this is falſe. Them that confeſſed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they put out of their Synagogues, althogh vniuſtly: &amp; for diuers kindes of ſinnes, they had diuerſe ſacrifices, which muſt bee offered by them, before there coulde bee any attonement for them. So the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſeparated ſome for ſinnes, and yet wicked perſons were ſtil of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Church. As for the places that they alleage, to proue that all in the Church muſt be faithfull, and haue the ſpirite, petaine ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the elect onely, and ſuch as are called according to purpoſe, as when it is ſaide, <hi>to ſo many as receaued him, he gaue power to bee made the ſonnes of God:</hi> And againe: <hi>I will write my lawes in their hearts:</hi> or elſe declare what euery one ought to be, and not what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one is, or ſhalbe: as when <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth: <hi>In Chriſt, neither circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſion auaileth any thing,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18839:58"/>nor vncircumciſion, but a newe creature:</hi> or elſe ſpeake of outward profeſſion &amp; ſhewe of faith: as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are called <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſpeaketh of in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter: or laſt of all, becauſe ſome haue theſe in trueth, they are aſcribed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they make one outward body with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; are denominated of the beſt, as when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified.</hi> As <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayeth, <hi>that a heape wherein lyeth more chaffe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wheate, is yet called a heape of wheate, and not of chaffe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a heape for the wheates ſake:</hi> So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be wicked &amp; vnfaithfull men in the Church, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church is called faithful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Church for the faithful &amp; godly, &amp; not for the wicked. Wherefore it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that the viſible Church ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt onelie of a faithfull and a regenerate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuch as haue the knowledge and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God: the outward profeſſion of theſe thinges, and the Sacraments, and the ſhadow as it were of the good, keepeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, although ſuch men are in it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their further damnation, except they repent. Thus much of that they ſay, the Church muſt be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of faithful people.</p>
            <p>The ſecond note which they make, is a ſeparation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heathen of the land. Theſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18839:58"/>heathens they tearme by many other names, calling them vngodly, prophane, and athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts: and the other common ſort of them take all ſuch as come to Church with vs, to bee no better: the other (that will ſeeme to ſpeake with more iudgement,) make ſuch to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, which are without the Church, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their former filthines, or haue done any thing that may ſhewe them to bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the couenant of Gods grace and free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Euery man that hath not knowledge to render a diſtinct account of his faith, in all neceſſary branches, they eſteeme prophane: thus they minſe it: but their writings and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhewe, that all are prophane with them, that are not of their owne ſocietie. Now the ſeparation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prophane perſons is ſo great a matter with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if but one ſuch man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine &amp; be kept in the Church, either he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it as they thinke, no Church, or at leaſt, maketh all exerciſes of prayers, and of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to be of no vertue nor value, but offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiue to God, &amp; hurtful to the Church. Therefore they accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our churches no churches, our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts no ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, our praiers no praiers, (if there were no other fault but this among vs) becauſe we retaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophane &amp; vngodly in our Churches. That the Church ought to be ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ſuch, or els that it can be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18839:59"/>no Church, and that the couenant otherwiſe is broken,
<note place="margin">Leuit. 20.24.</note> thus they labour to proue: Firſt, becauſe the Lord ſayeth in Moſes: <hi>I am the Lord your God, which haue ſeparated you from other people.</hi> I anſwere: the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſeparated from other nations by blood, and by outward ceremonies: we likewiſe by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Sacraments. And as for the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and vnbeleeuers, and vngodly, the Churches of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Iewes,</hi> could not be ſeparated from them, neither can the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> bee in this life freed from ſuch. Secondly, they would proue this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration by the wordes of <hi>Paul:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.6, 11.</note> 
               <hi>A little lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen leaueneth the whole lumpe.</hi> And againe: <hi>If any that is called a brother be a fornicator, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, or an idolater, or a rayler, or a drunckard, or an extortioner, with ſuch a one eate not.</hi> And to theſe,
<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 3.6.</note> that is ioyned as being of like nature: <hi>We charge you, that you withdrawe your ſelues from euery brother that walketh inordinately.</hi> Of theſe places they conclude, that there is an infection to the Church by the wicked retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and that the Church can not bee the Church, except this lawe of ſeparation bee practiſed. I anſwere, firſt, that the leauening and infection, was not in a wicked mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church, but in the reioycing at his wickednes. For ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth: <hi>your reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18839:59"/>is not good: knowe ye not that a little leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe?</hi> Moreouer, a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man may infect and leauen others by his example: the reſt he doth not infect. And laſt of all wee ſaye, our Church retaineth none ſuch, as that inceſtuous perſon was, if they be knowen. Where <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth: <hi>If any that is called a brother, be a fornicator, eate not with ſuch:</hi> and againe: <hi>Withdrawe your ſelues from euery brother that walketh inordinately:</hi> Firſt, I anſwere, he muſt be accuſed and conuicted to be ſuch, and admoniſhed: and if he amend not, he muſt be auoyded. Secondly, he muſt be ſhunned as touching familiaritie, with ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and fellowſhip, not to be companied with, as thoſe with whome wee eate famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arlie. For ſo much importeth that he ſayeth: <hi>Eate not with ſuch,</hi> and <hi>withdrawe your ſelues from ſuch.</hi> To ſhunne their companie in all thinges it is not meant: For in buying and ſelling, in ſubmitting our ſelues to their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, if they be our Magiſtrates, or in any other neceſſarie duetie, they ſhould not be auoyded. Laſt of all, their preſence defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not the Sacraments, nor maketh prayers vnprofitable ts vs, but to themſelues. <hi>He that eateth and drincketh vnworthely, eateth and drincketh his owne damnation.</hi> But they ſaye, wee are vnworthie, by admitting vnworthie
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18839:60"/>ones. I anſwere, it is not in euery one to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or to refuſe, and therefore euery one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be guiltie. And <hi>Iudas</hi> defiled not the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal lambe nor the Lords Supper, nor yet the reſt that were preſent, but himſelfe he defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Againe they ſay, if we may not eate commune breade with them, much leſſe may we eate the Lordes bread with them in the Sacrament. I anſwere, for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meat we are oft at choiſe in what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to take it: but the Sacrament wee muſt receiue with the Church, the wicked hath a commaundement to abſteine from it: and the worthy hath a commaundement to come vnto it: his preſuming to come that ought not, muſt not exclude me that ought to come. This I ſpeake of perſons ſuſpected to be reiected, &amp; in deede wicked in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but yet not conuicted openly before the Church. Of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are conuicted, I may ſay as <hi>Theodoret</hi> doth vpon this place. <hi>Si non oportet eos communis eſſe cibi participes, nec my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticiquidem certè &amp; diuini.</hi> If they muſt not be partakers of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread, then certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neither of the myſticall and diuine bread. and as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cum fratre in quo vitia haec reperiuntur, non ſolum Sacramenta non edenda ſed nec communem eſcam docet, vt eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſcat cum vitatur &amp; corrigat.</hi> He teacheth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18839:60"/>that we muſt not onely not eate the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but not ſo much as common meate with a brother in whom theſe ſinnes ſhall be found. <hi>Photius</hi> readeth theſe words other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. If any brother be named a fornicator, <hi>Talem fornicatorem, auarum, maledicum, ebrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum, hoc eſt, illum qui in propatulo talis eſt ita vt ſic ab omnibus &amp; dignoſcatur &amp; nominetur,</hi> and as he ſayde before, <hi>ita vt communem illam appellationem in ſeipſum amplexus, ex hac poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us quàm ex peculiari &amp; proprio nomine, &amp; cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcatur &amp; vocetur, hunc inquam, &amp; fugi impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat &amp; vitari, &amp; cum eo nec cibum ſumere, nec miſcere ſermones, nec ſimul vitam ducere, non autem illum quem quidam carpunt eſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledicum.</hi> Such a fornicator or rayler as is ſuch a one openly, ſo that he is after that ſort of all men knowen and named, ſo that he hath receiued this common name to himſelfe, and is rather knowen and called by it then by his proper name, he commaundeth ſuch a one to be auoyded and ſhunned, and that we ſhoulde neyther take meate, nor vſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar talke, nor leade our life with him, but hee commaundeth not that man ſo to bee ſhunned whome ſome carpe, as though hee were a backebiter. Thus they vnderſtand it of a man notoriouſly knowen and conuicted, and then of priuate
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18839:61"/>and familiar companie, and laſt of all, of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie in the Sacraments. Them that are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, the gouernement and lawes of our Church commaunde to be excluded, and it is put in practiſe: Wherefore our Church is not to be condemned for this. That which they obiect in the ſecond to the <hi>Corinthians: Be not vnequally yoked with the infidels:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> 
               <hi>For what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe?</hi> is ſpoken firſt of ſuch, as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the redeemer, but were heatheniſh idolaters: we haue none ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs. Secondly, if it be vnderſtood alſo of the wicked liuers, it forbiddeth familiar conuerſation with them: for with ſuch as we liue familiarlie, wee may be ſayde to bee yo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Thirdly, he will not haue vs bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with them, in that they are vnrighteous, and idolaters, neither by practiſe nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: but otherwiſe, to be in their companie vpon neceſſarie occaſions, he doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne. As for that which <hi>Paul</hi> practiſed in the <hi>Acts:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 19.9.</note> 
               <hi>When certaine were hardened and diſobeyed, ſpeaking euil of the way of God, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them, and ſeparated the diſciples:</hi> perſwadeth a ſeparation from the open, and profeſſed enemies of <hi>Christ.</hi> To ſuch <hi>dogs, the holy thinges</hi> of God are not to bee <hi>giuen.</hi> And of ſuch ſpeaketh Saint <hi>Iohn:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Iohn. 11.</note> 
               <hi>If there come
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18839:61"/>anie vnto you, and bring not this doctrine, bid him not God ſpeede: for hee that biddeth him God ſpeede, is partaker of his euil deedes.</hi> If he be a blaſphemer of the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen deſpiſer of his Goſpel, one that refuſeth him, and acknowledgeth him not as Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and God, hee is to be accounted an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, and by all meanes to be reiected. None ſuch are admitted of vs, or mingled with vs, being once knowen. Moreouer,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 65.11.</note> they thinke that <hi>Eſay</hi> condemneth vs, for admitting a whole pariſh to the holy Communion, when he ſaith: <hi>Yee are they that haue forſaken the Lorde, and forgotten my holy mountaine, and haue prepared a table for the multitude, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the drincke offering for the number. Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh not of receauing a number into ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, to offer to the Lorde: but rather of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to a multitude of Idols, in ſteade of the true God. For hee oppoſeth the onely true God to a multitude whome they ſerued: yea, ſome thinke that the names that are tranſlated a <hi>number,</hi> and <hi>multitude,</hi> doe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mercurie.</hi> Wherefore, this pertaineth not to the admitting of manie to the Communion. It was a commendation for the people and ſeruice of God, when they did all eate the paſſeouer, and offer ſacrifices together, as at their comming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:18839:62"/>and in the wildernes: and vnder <hi>Ioſias</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. It is much more to be miſliked with vs, that ſome refraine from the communion, then that ſo many come vnto it. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect many other things againſt the retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of wicked men in the ſocietie of the Church: but theſe are the chiefe. To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere all, woulde require a ſeuerall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
            <p>Their thirde note of a viſible Church is, that it muſt be gathered in the name of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">Eſai 11.14.</note> 
               <hi>Eſay</hi> did ſo prophecie. <hi>In that day the roote of Iſhai ſhall ſtand vp for a ſigne vnto the people, the nations ſhall ſeeke vnto it.</hi> Whole nations and many nations ſhoulde come to Chriſt in ſteede of one nation. Could this be but many wicked and vngodly ſhould be mixed? and howe ſhould the nations ſeeke to him? ſome in ſhewe, ſome in trueth: ſome by outward profeſſion, and ſome by inward feeling.
<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.32.</note> When our Sauiour ſayth, <hi>If I were lift vp from the earth, I woulde drawe all men vnto me,</hi> hee meaneth that ſuch as come in trueth, ſhall come by his power: but hee meaneth not, that there ſhould none come in outward faſhion onely, &amp; in word, and yet in heart be farre from him, &amp; in their deedes denie him. And as he ſayeth againe,
<note place="margin">Mat. 18.20</note> 
               <hi>where two or three are gathered together in

            <p>That which <hi>Peter</hi> ſaieth: <hi>To whome yee come as vnto a liuing ſtone, diſalowed of men, but choſen of God, and precious, and yee as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely ſtones, bee made a ſpiritual houſe, an holie Priesthoode, to offer vp ſpirituall Sacrifices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> This I ſay, is ſpoken of them which are called of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his eternall purpoſe. But none are thus ioyned to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but onely ſuch: yet for their ſakes, the reſt are ſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and take the name of that which is the chiefe: and ſo farre are they from making vs to bee ſeparated from God, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent not to their ſinnes, that they are tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and receaued into ſome outwarde honor of the Church for vs.</p>
            <p>Theſe places ſufficiently proue, that the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be ioyned vnto <hi>Chriſt</hi> the head. But what exception can bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt our Churche? howe can it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18839:63"/>be ſayde, that wee are not gathered together in the name of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> They ſaye, our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are gathered together, not in the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but in the name of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> This is a moſt vile ſlaunder againſt the Church. All that is proper to <hi>Antichriſt</hi> we withſtand, and therefore <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſeeing himſelfe caſt off, and vs not gathered in his name, ſtriueth by force and policie, to gather vs to himſelfe again. The name of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> included eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie his ſupremacie, his humane traditions againſt the written worde of God, his idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, his adoration of Saintes, his pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and reliques, his prayers for the dead and purgatorie, his iuſtification by workes, his ſatiſfactions for ſinnes, his doctrine of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, his vowes of pouertie, of ſingle life, his workes of ſupererogation, his pardons and the like. To come together in theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in the practiſe of thoſe thinges, is to bee gathered in the name of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> But thus wee doe not. Contrariewiſe, wee come to worſhip God in the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, to bee iuſtified by him, to heare his trueth: therefore wee are gathered in the name of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The fourth note of a viſible Church they make this, that it muſt worſhip <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> truelie. It is out of queſtion, that the true Church of God worſhippeth <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:18839:63"/>aright. But what can they alledge againſt vs and the worſhip that we performe to Chriſt? Firſt the commandement, Thou ſhalt make no grauen image. They account vs idolaters. Then that to the <hi>Corinths,</hi>

               <hi>If anie man ſay vnto thee, that is ſacrificed vnto idoles, eate it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him that ſhewed it.</hi> Our ſeruice they ſay was once offered to idoles, and therefore now muſt not be vſed. To theſe they ioine that of <hi>Eſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſai 66.17.</note> 
               <hi>They that ſanctifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie themſelues in the gardens behind a tree in the middeſt eating ſwines fleſh, and ſuch abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, euen the mouſe ſhalbe conſumed together ſaith the Lord.</hi> In their account our prayers &amp; the forme of our publike ſeruice is <hi>ſwines fleſh,</hi> or as a <hi>mouſe,</hi> which things were vncleane, and might not be offered to God by the law. And to this end they heape vp many places of like nature, as that of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 17.1.</note> &amp; ſuch other: <hi>Thou ſhalt offer to the Lorde thy God no bullocke nor ſheepe wherein is blemiſh, or any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill fauoured thing, for that is an abomination to the Lorde thy God.</hi> Such a ſacrifice they iudge the ſeruice that we offer to God by the booke of common prayer to be. Therefore they giue names of reproche and diſdaine vnto the booke, calling it the <hi>Statute booke,</hi> and <hi>ſtinted ſeruice,</hi> and <hi>ſtaruers booke,</hi> and ſuch like. Againſt this booke they fight
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18839:64"/>as againſt a moſt pregnant idole. We wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe not God aright, becauſe we worſhip him by this booke. The worſhippe of God is large: faith, hearing of his worde, reading of the Scriptures, and euerie good worke pertaineth to his worſhippe. All the ſeruice and duetie we doe to God, are not done by the reading and vſing of that booke. Nay all our prayers in the Church are not out of it. The preachers vſe the libertie of their mind, and motion of Gods ſpirite. So that all our worſhip, and all our prayers are not done by that booke.</p>
            <p>But they ſay, that booke and the worſhip done by it is idolatrous. Firſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it in generall, and then in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. In generall they miſlike for fiue things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the prayers are read. The reading of prayers, they ſay, can not bee with ſighes and grones, nor come of faith, nor proceede from the motion of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, nor haue any feeling ioyned with it, and hath no warrant by commaundement or practiſe from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles. Prayers read (they ſay) are onely for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and not for inuocation. This is their accuſation againſt the prayers that are read out of a booke. When our Sauiour ſayeth:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18839:64"/>
               <hi>The true worſhippers muſt worſhippe the father in ſpirite and trueth:</hi> and <hi>Paul, the ſpirite hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth our infirmtties,</hi> then they ſuppoſe that prayers read are excluded, as though they proceeded not of the ſpirite. Prayers are not ſo much vſed of the people, nor of any of vs as they ought to be. It is the chiefe meanes to obtaine Gods fauour, to keepe our ſelues in his feare, and to worke all goodnes in vs. If prayers by the booke were no praiers, we ſhould be much more barren in this exerciſe then we are. This were a good meanes for the deuill to banniſh pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from a great number altogether. I would know in reſpect of the hearer, what great difference it is, if the prayer be read to him or pronounced out of thy heart? Neyther way doth it come out of his heart as the fountaine. It commeth thus to paſſe alſo with many that vtter conceiued prayers, that for the moſt part they vſe the ſame fourme of words, &amp; the ſame matter in moſt points of their praiers. Againe what would this liberty of euery mans praying publike at his owne motion, hauing that office, bring vpon the Churches? Infinite &amp; intollerable babling in ſome, &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable &amp; moſt heretical petitions in a great number. But they ſay praiers read are not of the <hi>ſpirite,</hi> nor with ſighes,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18839:65"/>nor feeling. The very reading is not praying but the motion and deſire to God in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is praying. This motion is not hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but furthered by reading: becauſe it bringeth to the vnderſtanding that which the heart longeth after. As one candle recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth light of another, ſo euen in prayer the heart receiueth light and heate by meanes of the words read and heard. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſet down a fourme of words and ſayd, when you pray, pray thus. Nowe he that vſeth the wordes, and matter, and affection, <hi>prayeth thus,</hi> rather then he that vſeth the matter and affection onely. And the words of ſome petitions we vſe of neceſſitie, as <hi>forgiue vs our ſinnes or treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> and therefore may well vſe all. <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe in the garden prayed thriſe, ſaying the ſame words. <hi>Dauid</hi> made diuers Pſalmes to be ſung in Gods ſeruice, and intitleth them to the parties that ſhould be leaders in them. The hundred thirtie and ſixt pſalme was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſung in time of thankſgiuing, for great and extraordinarie victories: firſt <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe vſed it, then <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> and after that <hi>Iudas Maccabeus. Ioel</hi> in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faſt telleth what the prieſtes ſhould ſay, and biddeth them pronounce theſe words: <hi>Spare thy people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioel 2.17.</note> 
               <hi>O Lorde, and giue not thine heritage into reproche, that the heathen ſhoulde
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18839:65"/>rule ouer them: wherefore ſhould they ſay among the people, where is their God?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſe 14.2.</note> 
               <hi>Hoſeah</hi> biddeth the people take vnto them words, and ſay to the Lord: <hi>Take away all iniquitie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs graciouſly, ſo will we render the calues of our lippes, Aſſhur ſhall not ſaue vs, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will wee ride vpon horſes, neyther will wee ſay any more to the worke of our hands, yee are our Gods: for in thee the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe findeth mercie.</hi> God preſcribed a fourme of bleſſing to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonne,
<note place="margin">Num. 56.23.</note> wherewith they ſhoulde bleſſe the people: commaunding them to ſay, <hi>The Lorde bleſſe thee and keepe thee,</hi> and ſo ſoorth. <hi>Moſes</hi> vſed a fourme of wordes as a prayer at the going forwarde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the Arke:
<note place="margin">Numb. 10.35, 36.</note> and <hi>Dauid</hi> in his prayer hath the ſame. Seeing theſe things are ſo,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.2.</note> prayers read may be vſed, &amp; a man by them may perfourme vnto God ſpirituall and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſeruice.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing for which they miſlike the booke is, becauſe it is preſcribed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and vſed continually. This cutteth off the libertie of the Church (they ſay) and bringeth it into bondage: this is tedious to men, and <hi>Penrie</hi> is not aſhamed to ſay, it is lothſome to God to be ſerued ſo oft as it were with one diſh. The libertie that theſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18839:66"/>men chalenge is ſuch, as that they will be bound to nothing, eſpecially in religion. &amp; in things indifferent, neither by prince nor by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny law of man be it neuer ſo good &amp; godly, the thing is miſliked, becauſe it is preſcribed and impoſed vpon vs. Doth the very impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and bond by law make it vnholy? Then acknowledge not the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> nor receiue <hi>the canonicall Scripture,</hi> nor ſeeke to knowe Gods commandements nor <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith: For theſe things by law are impoſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. But this diminiſheth not our liberty, nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away our willing ſeruing of God, in theſe things impoſed, but rather maketh vs more willing. And as for tediouſneſſe to the Lord, becauſe theſe prayers are old and vſuall, it is not to be feared. For in his ſeruice he requireth not newe words, but a newe heart. The worſhippe and prayer is newe to God, ſo oft as our heart is renewed with zeale and true repentance, and good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it. For the prayer to God is not the outward word, but the inward deſire and affection.</p>
            <p>The third thing in generall for which they condemne the booke is, for that it is mans inuention. Whatſoeuer man deuiſeth, that they count vncleane and not to be vſed in prayer. When mens traditions and inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18839:66"/>are reprooued in Gods ſeruice by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hitherto by all godly writers, thoſe things haue bene vnderſtood which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods word. Things agreeable are not ſo accounted mens inuentions, that they ſhould be condemned. For if ſimply to come from the wit and braine of man be naught, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were preaching to be baniſhed, and then euen conceiued prayers muſt be excluded, and ſo much more, becauſe they be new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions euery day: and this, if it be any, it is but one. It is not a deuiſe of man, therefore to be reiected, which is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the word of God, as thoſe things in this booke are, whereby we worſhip God.</p>
            <p>The fourth generall cauſe of reiecting the booke is, for that it is in many points ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Popes porteſſe. Therefore <hi>Barrowe</hi> calleth it a great colloppe, or a pigge of that mezeled hogge. In this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe another of them ſayeth, wee beare the image of the beaſt, for that we vſe ſome part of his forme of liturgie. It is certaine that a great part of the publike prayer in that booke which the <hi>Romanes</hi> vſe, was practiſed in the Church before <hi>the beaſt</hi> came in that chaire. And often times Gods people haue eyther taken or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18839:67"/>reſumed thoſe things to Gods worſhippe, which haue bene abuſed by idolaters. The ſpoiles of <hi>Egypt</hi> &amp; of <hi>Iericho,</hi> the veſſels of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple abuſed by the <hi>Babylonians</hi> were againe applied to Gods ſeruice. If we vſed any thing wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> ſheweth himſelfe to bee the <hi>beaſt,</hi> as his worſhipping of dead Saints, and images, and the Maſſe, and ſuch like, then we might be ſayde to beare his image or his marke: But in the prayers that wee haue, there is no part, no limme, no clawe of that <hi>beaſt.</hi> The people of God muſt not faſhion themſelues like the <hi>Cananites,</hi> nor the heathen about them, in any thing wherein they are idolatrous and impious: but in that they haue as men, Gods people may be like them. As they are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> we will not be like the <hi>Romanes:</hi> but as they are <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> we may be like them. In taking good things from them wee take not any thing that was theirs, but we take to our ſelues that which was our owne. We muſt not vſe the <hi>Bible,</hi> nor the name of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> if we will haue nothing that they had.</p>
            <p>The fift and laſt thing for which in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall they caſt away the booke is, for that it mainteineth a reading miniſtery. A booke of common prayer is no cauſe of a reading
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18839:67"/>Miniſter. The chiefeſt cauſe is, that preachers will not be had, nor can be made in this ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der maintenance of ſundry Churches: the next cauſe is, the couetouſnes and wicked dealing of many godleſſe patrones: and a third cauſe is this, contention and ſtrife that is raiſed in the Church. This hath caſt out manie that were in, and hath driuen backe manie that were comming on: this hath cauſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe to forſake the ſtudie of Diuinitie and learning altogether. But the booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer is no cauſe of it: for the preachers with vs vſe it, and where all are preachers, there is a ſet forme obſerued, and is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to bee had of all well ordered Churches. Theſe are the thinges, for which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the booke in generall.</p>
            <p>Now in particular, they trifle about many things: As firſt about the holy dayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome they call double Idoles, and double feaſtes, Hallowmas, Chriſtmas, Candlemas, Eaſter, Whitſonday, Trinitie ſonday: Then there are the Ladies dayes, Saints dayes with the Eues faſt, and feaſtes, and deuiſed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip vnto them. Laſt of all, they reckon the celebrating of dayes to Angels, as Michael, and the naming of manie <hi>Archangels.</hi> This cauil will eaſily be anſwered. For firſt wee make not the Calender anie parte of Gods
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18839:68"/>worſhip: Wherefore it is vaine to accuſe vs of a falſe worſhip by that, when wee put no parte of his worſhippe in it. That diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth the times, and directeth vs to the Pſalmes and Scriptures: but is no parte of Gods ſeruice, no more then a marke by the waye to direct them which goe by, is a parte of the way. The names maye bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what offenſiue where Maſſe is added: but in the olde tongue from whence our language came (long before the corruptions of the Maſſe were crept in) the worde ſignified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Tide,</hi> or ſome ſolemn time: and the common people haue vſed to ſpeake ſo, and the name <hi>Miſſa,</hi> from whence that is ſuppoſed to come, is read in ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in a good and a godly meaning: yea, and in moſt Calenders thoſe names are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The Saintes wee worſhip not, nor Angels, neither with prayers, faſtes, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing: But God wee worſhip, and take occaſion at ſuch times, when wee call to minde them by whome the worſhip of God hath bin ſpred throughout the world. The people of God haue vſed and appointed moe dayes to publike prayer, and Gods ſeruice then the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heſter. Euang. Ioan.</note> without controlement: as the feaſt of <hi>Purim</hi> and of <hi>Dedication.</hi> Laſt of all, thoſe dayes, except the natiuitie of our
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18839:68"/>Sauiour, and thoſe that fall vſually on the Lordes day, are in moſt places growne to be equall with the reſt: Our people are readie ynough, to make no difference of dayes in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>The next thing that commeth vnder their cenſure, are the faſtes, Lent, imber dayes, Aſhwedneſday, Maundie, Holy thurſday, Goodfridaye, and the reſt. Two thinges are regarded of the Churche, in diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing theſe times from others. Firſt a time to bee obſerued of all, for the vſe of fiſhe, and refraining from fleſh, that nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might bee maintained, and that ſeeing wee may haue prouiſion of all kinde of foode, wee doe not continuallie vſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie one, to which wee are moſt giuen, to the decaie thereof, and hinderance of the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that there maie bee vſed alſo a moderate abſtinence, not to the honour of Saintes, nor as though there were anie worſhippe of God in it of it ſelfe, but that our bodies maye bee kept vnder, and the minde might bee made the fitter to ſerue the Lorde. If all thoſe dayes and others, were vſed in a whole or halfe abſtinence, it were better for mens bodies and ſoules, and for the commonwealth, then it is.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18839:69"/>The ſuperſtition and merite in ſuch thinges is condemned: but either a ciuile or holie vſe, to the better ordering of our bodies and affections, of none that are wiſe can be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyked.</p>
            <p>A third matter of reprehenſion is (as they call it) a blaſphemous abuſe of ſcriptures, ſhredding, and rending them from their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe and true vſe, to bend and apply them to the Idole feaſtes. This accuſation is both fooliſh and impudent. If they thinke (as it ſeemes they doe) that it is not lawfull to print or reade by it ſelfe, ſome portion of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole body, it is fooliſh: for what offence can there be, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king choiſe of ſome parte for inſtruction, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bodie is left whole notwithſtanding? And to ſay they are turned from their true ſenſe, it is impudent: for in the ſame words &amp; meaning are they ſet downe in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion booke, as they are in the bodie of the ſcripture: neither doe we apply them to the feaſtes, but to our ſelues, to be inſtructed by them.</p>
            <p>The fourth crime they ſet downe in theſe wordes: Abominable Collectes ouer, for, and to the dead. What can bee ſpoken more ſpitefull and ſhameleſſe? We praye neither for the dead, nor to the dead: wee praye for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18839:69"/>our ſelues, at the buriall of the dead.</p>
            <p>In the fiſt place, about Baptiſme and that which pertaineth to it, they finde many faults. They ſaye it is corrupted with the ſigne of the croſſe, with godfathers, and godmothers, with the Fonte, with vnlawfull and vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vowes of goſſips: to theſe they ioyne purification or churching of women, with their offerings, haſtie baptiſme by Midwiues, biſhopping and ſecond baptiſme: by theſe thinges, they iudge that baptiſme is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But why ſhould the ſigne of the croſſe corrupt it? Is it ſo odious to expreſſe the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of that whereon <hi>Christ</hi> dyed, without opinion of adding grace, without giuing any worſhip to it, but onely for remembrance? there is none impietie it it. And what impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible vowe doe the godfathers and godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make? They ſay not (as they alleage.) that the childe ſhall beleeue, but that it doth, in way of Sacrament and outwarde profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in as much as it is offered to baptiſme, which is <hi>Sacramentum fidei,</hi> and is borne of parents that are profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith. And as for the procuring of theſe thinges in action in the childe, there is none that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth I thinke anie furder, then as it maye lye in them conueniently, and as neede ſhall require. But what can there be in the Font
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18839:70"/>to corrupt baptiſme, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Church wals to corrupt prayers, and ſcriptures, and and preaching, and all? Women are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, as though they were otherwiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane: but they giue thankes for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, and for the increaſe of mankinde and the Church: In giuing thankes for Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, there is not anie fault. Confirmation is retained as a meanes to procure the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the children, or as a tryall of it, not as a newe baptiſme, nor as anie Sacrament, nor as that which ſhoulde conferre grace, otherwiſe then by prayer to God for it. Baptiſme by women is not warranted by the booke, nor allowed to bee put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
            <p>About the Lordes ſupper they haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie cauils, as that it is ſoulde for two pence a head: that the inſtitution is broken and changed in the deliuerie: that there is a ſtage-like dialogue betweene prieſt, clarke, and people: that there are newe Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall lawes and iniunctions added, the Prieſt to ſtand at the Northſide of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the people to kneele, verſe, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: that there is popiſh and idolatrous houſeling of the ſicke: that there is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh viſiting and pardoning of the ſicke, with this Sacrament: Theſe are hainous
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18839:70"/>thinges.</p>
            <p>The Sacrament (they ſay) is ſould for two pence: who ſelleth it, who buieth it ſo? He is to giue that, whether he receaue or no: It is no price of the Sacrament, but a poore alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Miniſter: The inſtitution is not broken in the deliuerie. The wordes of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution are then vſed, when the bread and wine are ſet apart for the vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo much ſet apart for it, as is vſed in it. The wordes in the deliuerie, are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie them to the perſons, to ſtirre vp their faith: the inſtitution was paſt before. For the ſpeeches vttered by the Miniſter, and clearke, and people, there is no fault in the matter, but they condemne the forme. They thinke the Miniſter muſt vtter all that is ſpoken: the people muſt onely ſay, Amen. That they are commanded to ſaye, and they are not forbidden to ſaye more. How can that ſound of the multitude bee made in the prayſing of God, compared to the ſound of many waters, and of mightie thunders, if the people ſaye nothing in Gods ſeruice? Their owne ſpeach maketh them more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and ſtirreth vp their mindes the rather. The finding fault with ſtanding, kneeling, and ſuch neceſſarie and ſeemelie geſtures, proceedeth of infinite curioſitie, and moſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18839:71"/>froward peeuiſhnes. We can not be together but we muſt haue ſome place, ſome geſture, and theſe are the fitteſt. Laſt of all, as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and the worde of comfort, ſo likewiſe the Sacrament may be giuen to the ſicke. There is no pardon otherwiſe giuen to him by it, then to other men, at other times. If hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and repent, he hath forgiuenes by faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and it is ſealed and confirmed to him by the Sacrament. Thus much of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular faultes which they are moſt offended with.</p>
            <p>Moreouer beſides theſe, they carpe at comminations, which are nothing but ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of ſcripture: and how bitter ſoeuer the curſes are, yet they are the curſes of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as offend. They finde fault with a ſeuenfold repetition of the Lordes prayer at one meeting: ſome of them are oft omitted: with toſſing of Pſalmes and ſentences to and fro like tennis balles: which is a prophane ſpeach: and the thing is not commanded: and it may well be practiſed, ſo they reade, and ſpeake in ſuch ſorte, that all men may heare and vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the chiefe thinges, with which they finde fault in the booke. The moſt of them are circumſtances, and as it were the ſhels: the kirnel is the confeſſion of our ſinnes,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18839:71"/>the asking of thinges neceſſarie to ſoule and bodie, for the common ſtate and our ſelues, the prayſing of God for his benefites, the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of Gods will, his worde and teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe are the ſubſtance of the booke, and of Gods worſhip. They make a buzzing about mens eares, with trifles and vanities for the moſt parte: and for theſe, they will turne all vpſide downe: which are ſuch things in deede many of them, as it would not come into our mindes once to ſpeake of them, if their exclamations and outcries did not ſtirre vs of neceſſitie to it.</p>
            <p>Yet there is one thing pertaining to Gods worſhip among vs, which they can not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues vnto. An othe is a parte of the honor we giue to God, when vpon iuſt cauſe in the trueth, wee call his name to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: this we do, by laying the hand vpon the booke of holy ſcripture. The othe is taken in the name of God, that gaue his worde to his Church, by the promiſes and threatnings that he in it hath made vnto vs: the booke is kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and touched in ſigne thereof: otherwiſe, by the dead paper, or ynke, or couer, wee are not willed, neither ought we to ſweare: and this hath neither impietie nor idolatrie in it, no more then if a man did lift vp his eyes, or his hands to heauen, when he doth it in more
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18839:72"/>vehement expreſſing of his ſincere and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt meaning in it. Thus much of the fourth note of their Church, <hi>Gods true worſhip:</hi> for corruption whereof, they accuſe vs falſely.</p>
            <p>The fift note of the viſible Church, they make to bee the obeying of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> as their king, prieſt, and prophet: Thus ſhould <hi>Chriſt</hi> be receaued, or elſe he is not receaued at all to anie benefite. Firſt then they goe about to ſhewe, that wee acknowledge not <hi>Chriſt</hi> to bee our king: wee receaue him not as king (they ſaye) becauſe wee reiect his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and ſtand vnder the Antichriſtian yoke of popiſh gouernement. There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which pertaine to <hi>Chriſts</hi> gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reigne as hee is king, which wee haue, yea, all thinges that are neceſſarie and ſubſtantiall partes of that his office. Firſt the ſpiritual gouernement in the ſoule, by which hee reigneth in vs, to the peace of conſcience, and the vanquiſhing of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of ſinne and ignorance is founde among vs, and wee ſpecially reioyce in it. Of this, it is ſayde: <hi>the kingdome of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you:</hi> and that, <hi>the kingdome of God is not meate and drinke: but peace and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ioy in the holy ghoſt:</hi> and that, <hi>wee are tranſlated from the kingdome of darkenes, to the kingdome of light.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="125" facs="tcp:18839:72"/>
            <p>Secondly, his worde read and preached, reprouing ſinne, and teaching righteouſnes, is among vs. Of this it is ſaide, <hi>the ſcepter of thy kingdome is a right ſcepter:</hi> and for this partelie, the Goſpell is called <hi>the Goſpell of the kingdome.</hi> Theſe are the principall thinges pertaining to <hi>Chriſtes</hi> kingdome heere in earth: and theſe, by his grace and goodnes, wee haue among vs. Nowe they haue a third branch of a kingly reigne, which is a forme of outwarde gouernement, the ende and ſcope whereof is, that order ſhould bee kept, ſinne ſhoulde bee puniſhed, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected among Gods people, by eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call puniſhments, and cenſures. This (they ſaye) wee want, and therefore doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Chriſt</hi> our king. They imagine that <hi>Christ</hi> hath ſet a forme externall, by which euery congregation ſhoulde bee fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in this behalfe, as that there muſt bee (beſides the teachers) in euerie congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a certaine number of Elders, which muſt electe, depoſe, ordeine, make orders and decrees, reprooue, ſuſpende and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, when they ſee good. This is the kingdome which they ſtriue for: if this bee not in euery pariſh, <hi>Chriſt</hi> (they ſaye) can not bee our king, we haue caſt him off. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our king, not onelie by his
<gap reason="missing" resp="#OXF" extent="2 pages">
                  <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:18839:73"/>neceſſarie to ſaluation, &amp; directlie commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as the Prieſtes did in the dayes of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</hi> If wee reiected gouernement, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed all correction and puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for ſinne, we reiected an expreſſe commaundement of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our king. But in reiecting the cenſures of ten, or ſixe, or any ſuch number in euerie congregation, wee doe not repugne anie open or knowen commaundement of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our king.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, notwithſtanding the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which wee haue, and the excluding of that gouernement which they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude, wee haue <hi>Chriſt</hi> to bee our king, and hee acknowledgeth vs his people, ſubiectes, and armie.</p>
            <p>Nowe wee muſt ſee, what it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to thinke that we denie the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode of our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and ſo make that he is no prieſt to vs. If hee be no prieſt for vs, then hath hee not ſacrificed, and ſatiſfied for our ſinnes: then hath hee not, neither doth make interceſſion for vs. Hee that denieth the prieſthoode of <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> loſeth theſe his benefites: <hi>He is a prieſt for euer, after the order of Melchiſedech:</hi> and all muſt come vnto God by him. Now then, wherein doe wee deny his prieſthoode? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaye they) we ſacrilegiouſly prophane
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18839:73"/>his name with our idolatrie, and becauſe we proſtitute his blood, and make him a prieſt and ſacrifice to infidels, and moſt wicked of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders. His prieſthoode were denyed, if we truſted in anie but in his ſacrifice for the forgiuenes of our ſinnes, or if wee made pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God in anie mediators name but his. But (they ſaye) wee denie his prieſthoode, becauſe wee make prayer vnto him out of a booke: for this they call idolatrie. But by that booke wee praye to God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in his name, for thinges agreeable to his will, with faith, and from the heart. Therefore there is no idolatrie in that, nor any thing that derogateth from his prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing, wherein wee denie his prieſthoode, is (they ſaye) becauſe wee proſtitute the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and make him a prieſt and ſacrifice to infidels, and the moſt wicked offenders. In baptiſme (they ſay) it is proſtituted, becauſe wee giue the Sacrament to the whole nation: in the Supper, becauſe wicked impenitent perſons are receaued of vs to it: and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in both, becauſe at the firſt by procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the prince, and vpon the ſudaine, from idolatrie and poperie, ſtreight after the reigne of Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> all were receaued
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18839:74"/>to the Sacrament: and that people is yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>But for the infantes to bee baptiſed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the parentes were wicked, there is good warrant. Firſt, for that their auncetors were receaued into the couenant, and the ſinne of the father ſhall bee vpon himſelfe, and is perſonall, and neceſſarily the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſeth not, God himſelfe ſayeth: <hi>the ſonne ſhall not beare the iniquitie of the father.</hi> Another reaſon is, becauſe there is hope of the childe, that hee ſhall bee brought vp to knowe God, and beleeue in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and laſt of all, for that there is none baptized, but ſome doe vndertake for him, that it ſhall be performed: they marueile that a whole nation ſhoulde bee baptiſed: and yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſaide: <hi>Go teach all nations, baptiſing them.</hi> And as touching the whole multitude recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued after the ende of the reigne of Queene <hi>Marie:</hi> Firſt it can not bee ſaide, but they had teaching in the dayes of the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie king <hi>Edwarde,</hi> although they fell from it. Secondly, they came not as meere ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, but as men from an aberration in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, which they might eaſilie correct, if they were not wilfull: And what ſhoulde that preiudice the Church nowe? If they had
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18839:74"/>not bene taught then, yet nowe they haue bene taught aboue theſe thirtie yeres. Laſt of all, in ſuch maner Gods people haue bene reduced to Gods worſhippe againe from idolatrie vnder <hi>Ioſias</hi> and <hi>Ezechias</hi> Kings of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Nowe concerning the Sacrament of the Supper, we doe not proſtitute it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. We cannot count any in this land infidels, whome we know and receiue to the Sacrament of the Supper. All make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith, all acknowledge <hi>Chriſt</hi> God and redeemer, and hope for ſaluation in him: if they haue not this, we may and ought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect them. If any neglect his duety, it is no preiudice nor cauſe to condemne the reſt. So likewiſe, knowen wicked offenders, (if they be impenitent) are remooued: and if it were ſo that ſome ſuch as are not to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, doe communicate, is that a denying of his ſacrifice and prieſthoode to the reſt? It is euill applyed to ſuch: but it is not thereby plucked from the reſt. It is applyed to him that hath no benefite: but he is not depriued, to whom the benefite belongeth. The places of Scripture by which they woulde prooue, that we denie <hi>Chriſts</hi> prieſthoode for giuing the Sacrament to ſuch as we receiue, are theſe:
<note place="margin">Ezec. 44.7.</note> firſt the complaint of God in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel: Yee haue brought into my Sanctuarie
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18839:75"/>ſtrangers, vncircu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed in heart &amp; vncircu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed in fleſh, to be in my Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuary &amp; to pollute my houſe when ye offer my bread.</hi> God reproueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for making ſuch prieſts as were vncircu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed in fleſh, &amp; ſtrangers, euen heathens, &amp; idolaters: for to be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuary, &amp; there to miniſter, was to be a prieſt. Such we make not. &amp; this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth nothing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> receiuing of any among vs to the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. To this they ioine another complaint of <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 1.10.</note> 
               <hi>The enemie hath ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out his hand vpon all her pleaſant things: for ſhe hath ſeene the heathen enter into her ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, whom thou diddeſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand that they ſhould not enter into thy Church.</hi> This is ſpoken of the enemies, which ſhould poſſeſſe al they had, &amp; be Lords ouer them, &amp; ſpoile their Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie by violence. Theſe were heathen idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> Such ſhould not enter into the Church. We receiue none ſuch as profeſſe themſelues to be idolaters, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and are open perſecuters of his people. Thus it is apparant, we do not proſtitute the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſuch as they name: &amp; if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do, the Church &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not allow it: &amp; againe, that this is not a denying of <hi>Chriſts</hi> prieſthood &amp; ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, &amp; the putting of another thing in ſtead thereof as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiſts did, but rather a miſſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of it where it ſhould not be applied.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18839:75"/>Wherefore, wee doe not deny his prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>As concerning the propheticall office of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that by vs is not obſcured and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but magnified and highly aduanced. His word onely hath ſoueraigne authoritie, it is publiſhed, and it is receiued in our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Let them ſhewe wherein we derogate from his prophecie.</p>
            <p>The firſt accuſation is a ſlander; as that we adde to the word, that we vſe humane traditions, we obtrude things contrary to the word, and that we oppugne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the manifeſt trueth. Theſe things muſt be anſwered in the particulars. We adde nothing as neceſſarie to ſaluation, we teach nothing contrary, and we imbrace all the knowne and euident trueth. But that is not an addition, or a knowen trueth, or a thing contrary to the word which they imagine to be ſo. But (as I ſayd) theſe things are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the particulars.</p>
            <p>The next accuſation is, that we giue not obedience to the word of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but vſe it as a mantel to couer our ſinne, rather then as a rule to direct our life. We cannot ſay, that all doe obey the Goſpell in heart: and ſome in hypocriſie vſe it, as a cloake for ſinne. This fruſtrateth his prophecie with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18839:76"/>thoſe perſons, ſo that they haue no benefite by it. But his prophecie hardeneth and not onely ſofteneth, and there be in the Church, ſuch as waxe worſe and worſe, as well as thoſe which waxe better and better. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>Prophet</hi> vnto both. Neither the lawes nor the publike teaching doe mind or propound this, that the word of God ſhould be diſobeied, or that any ſhould make it a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for ſinne. The fault of ſome perſons may not be imputed to the whole Church, nor to the lawes and gouernment.</p>
            <p>Another thing whereby we weaken or quite fruſtrate (they ſay) the <hi>prophecie of Chriſt</hi> amongſt vs, is becauſe we ſeeke not a true miniſterie, but mainteine a falſe, of which ſort (they ſay) the whole miniſterie of the land is, which are permitted to teach in the publike places, to whom eare is giuen. Such are their words. This accuſation is very large and grieuous. No true miniſters in the whole land? All falſe miniſters? Why do they ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vs? Is it becauſe we teach falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or haue corrupted the faith, or do teach hereſies? No ſuch thing. They obiect none of theſe againſt vs. Then I hope we may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere them the eaſier, and be heard the more willingly purging our ſelues. They cannot obiect vnto vs hereſie, nor falſe doctrine, nor
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18839:76"/>teaching of any thing that deſtroyeth the grounds of ſaluation. What be the things then which they ſay make vs a falſe miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? I will recite vnto you all which they lay againſt vs, I will diſſemble nothing: the crimes then are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt they ſay, we haue not the names of Miniſters of the goſpel, but are called Prieſts, Parſons, Vicars, and Curates. It is not in our power what other men will call vs. Some of theſe names are giuen of the maintenaunce whereby we liue, and pertaine not to our callings: we delight to be counted the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpell. But this about the names, is a vaine cauill.</p>
            <p>Secondly they condemne our preparation to the miniſterie, which is by ſtudie and bringing vp in the Vniuerſities. Schooles and Vniuerſities they cannot whollie conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. The Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> had the ſchooles of the Prophets: and euer among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> they haue bene eſteemed as the beſt nurſes of the miniſterie. They condemne them for the ſtudy of humaine learning, and for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vices among ſome perſons. If for the faults of ſome of the perſons that profeſſe any kind of life, the trade it ſelf be to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, then no courſe of life muſt be taken in the world. The ſtudie of <hi>Logike, Rhetorike,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18839:77"/>Philoſophie,</hi> and the <hi>Mathematicals</hi> is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that without them we ſhould be barbarous, and but by the helpe of them, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can any perfection (by ordinary meanes) be attained in <hi>Phiſike, Lawe,</hi> or <hi>Diuinitie.</hi> There are none but madde men, which can condemne Vniuerſities.</p>
            <p>Thirdly they miſlike our entrance into the miniſterie: none of vs is choſen by a whole congregation, nor ordayned by laying on of the hands of the Elderſhippe, nor iuſt tryall made of giftes and conuerſation. But we are ordained by one man the Byſhoppe, and are thruſt vpon the places where we take charge whether the people will or no. The ordaining of a miniſter by one or fewe is not againſt the word of God. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> appointed Elders by the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands at <hi>Antioch.</hi> And <hi>Titus</hi> was left in <hi>Creta,</hi> to ordaine Elders in euery ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Wherefore it wanteth not the word of God, that Paſtours are ordayned by one that hath ſkill, yet that one with vs doth it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and other ancient fathers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themſelues to haue aucthoritie to doe the like. If they be not examined and tryed as they ought, the fault is in the Byſhoppe. That they are preferred by one to their charge, that is not againſt the word,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18839:77"/>ſeeing there is nothing in the word that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth the election by the multitude, or inioineth it to be perpetuall.</p>
            <p>The fourth accuſation is, againſt the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned &amp; vnpreaching miniſters, which is a crime that they make to touch al. for ſo much as they are no miniſters at all that cannot preach, therefore they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: then all the reſt eyther by ſilence, or by conſent, or by preaching in their charges, or by defending them to be miniſters, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo guilty. And the whole people are wrapped (they ſay) by them in the ſame ſentence of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, for either keeping vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make that they are no ſacraments, no praiers, no word of promiſe and ſaluation, that is vttered by them, but that all their actions are voyd and fruſtrate. This being ſo great a matter, would be examined by it ſelfe at large. But in a word to touch it. The reader bringeth the word of reconciliation and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſheweth the way of repentaunce and amendement of life, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth the Sacramentes and prayers in a publike function layde vpon him by the Church; therefore he is a miniſter, and a man may ſafely heare him, and receiue the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at his hand. Hee nouriſheth fayth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18839:78"/>by reading, therefore he may beget it: for wherewith it is nouriſhed, therewith it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. By the ſame meanes wherewith our beſt preachers haue bin both at the planting of the Goſpell after the darkenes of Poperie in this land, and are made now dayly, and continued in their ſufficiencie; by the ſame meanes may the people come to faith, and be continued in it. And who ſeeth not, that reading both begetteth, and chiefly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and nouriſheth many preachers? And ſeeing it is the ſpirit that giueth grace, and breatheth where it liſteth, why not vpon the good heart when the word is read? In the time of perſecution vnder <hi>Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> the reading of ſome fewe bookes, brought many to the light, and did preſerue them in it. Euery faithfull man hath expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience how his owne reading edifieth, why ſhould not then the publike reading edifie? The want of ſkill to preach maketh not a nullitie in him, as in a child or a beaſt: for he giueth conſent to that he taketh in hand, and nature it ſelfe excludeth ſuch from the office. <hi>Faith</hi> in deed <hi>commeth by hearing, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the word of God, and they cannot heare without a preacher.</hi> But reading is a certaine kind of preaching: for if the ſhewing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe without words when <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:18839:78"/>deſcended into hell, was and is of many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men called preaching, and ſo they could vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the preaching that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of: then why might not the reading of the word of God be called a preaching of it?
<note place="margin">Act. 15.20.</note> And <hi>Iames</hi> calleth the reading preaching. <hi>Moſes,</hi> he ſaith <hi>of old time hath in euery citie them that preach him, ſeeing he is read in the Synagogues euery Sabbath day.</hi> This importeth that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is a kind of preaching. There were mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that only read in the Synagogues of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> When they were ſo ready to deſire a ſtranger to ſpeake, it ſeemed it was not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to haue an expounder in euery Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue. They were not alwaies preachers that did baptize. <hi>Chriſts</hi> diſciples baptized, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. when as (in the iudgment of many that are learned) <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not ſent forth any yet to preach. I ſpeake not this to make reading &amp; preaching in the Church equal, or that reading ſhould baniſh preaching, or preaching exclude reading. The expounding of ſcripture and applying of it to the preſent ſtate, by the working of Gods ſpirit in the mouth of a man called for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> purpoſe, is moſt excellent &amp; neceſſary for al Churches, &amp; our Lawes and gouernment do require it. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as ſome conclude, let all be readers, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh preachers quite, heare only the reader, if
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18839:79"/>there be no excellency nor neceſſitie of the preacher aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reader. Therfore let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher by voice &amp; by inuention fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit and his own heart, haue the firſt place, and (as the caſe ſtandeth with vs) the reader muſt not haue no place at all. They may be weake mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, or miniſters of neceſſitie, or aſſiſting miniſters, although they be not the chiefe nor moſt perfect and ſufficient. Thus much of that matter.</p>
            <p>The fift defect they find in the miniſtery, is in the dueties which are put vpon them or taken from them. Burying of the dead, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of man wife in marriage, making of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſermons, going about the bounds of pariſhes: all theſe (in their opinions) are no works of the Miniſter of the Goſpell. And againe, whereas they ought to gouerne in their congregations together with others, all gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is taken from vs. beſides, wheras no Miniſter ſhould be aboue a <hi>Paſtor, Byſhop.</hi> are aboue vs, therefore (ſay they) are we no Paſtours nor Miniſters of the Goſpel. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayer doth aptly agree and is a duety of our calling. This is not wickedly ioyne with buriall and marriage, conſidering our owne frailtie which are alwaies neere death and the difficulties in mariage which God onely helpeth. God himſelfe ioyned the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:18839:79"/>mariage, &amp; why may not his Miniſters now doe it in his name, ſeeing yet they which are married are ioyned together by God? The word may be preached in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, and no time amiſſe, when the people come together and are fit to be taught. What time better to comfort them that mourne, or to rebuke the ſinner, or to put vs in mind of our frailtie, then at the buriall of the dead? The going about the bounds and limits of pariſhes pertaineth to his own maintenance and the common quiet: therefore the doing of theſe things hath nothing contrary to his duty, ſeeing they hinder not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, but rather further it. And as for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it is not mete for al: ſo much neither as they do chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, was neuer in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to euery particular paſtor. To admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, to ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to rebuke is granted to vs, and more is not neceſſary: the labor of preaching is inough. <hi>Paſtours</hi> haue had ſuperiours ouer them in the churches: Firſt <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> then <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> and ſo is it at this day. Neyther is there any diſorder in it. In a moderate ſubiection the miniſter may better performe his duty, &amp; more ſafely. His pouerty and meanes cannot ſuſtaine the burthen of publike gouernment any further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for teaching, exhorting, rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, &amp; ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding or withholding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18839:80"/>from the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>In the ſixt place they will perſwade that we are no miniſters, becauſe many remaine ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnder vs, &amp; the ſinnes of men are not cut off but abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, notwithſtanding al we do. This ſhould argue Gods curſe vpon vs, and vpon our miniſterie. If none did profite by vs, we might miſtruſt our ſelues: but of many we may ſay, <hi>Yee are our Epiſtle, yee beare witneſſe</hi> of the fruite which we bring. Yea this continuall peace all this time is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnder God and our moſt gracious <hi>Queene,</hi> to be aſcribed to the preaching of the word of God among vs. That ſects and poperie ſpread not ouer all, it is to be imputed much vnto publike preaching. There is no place in this land but the word of God worketh in the hearts of ſome, to their conuerſion.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenth crime is againſt our mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. We liue by ſet ſtipends, &amp; by tenths, and we depend vpon noble men, and ſuch as are able to pleaſure vs, we preach for gaine, we hunt after liuings, and ioyne diuerſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. An vnlawfull maintenance, if this were granted ſo to be, maketh not an vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miniſterie. If for gaine we ſhould peruert the truth, then we ſhould degenerate from our office. why ſhould ſet ſtipe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds hurt our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery?
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18839:80"/>Is an vncertaine liuing meeter then a certaine? Tenths do not reuiue the <hi>ceremonial</hi> law, we take not them in that ſence. The <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> had them, &amp; afterward beſtowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon the Churches. We chalenge them not by the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but by the gift of the prince. And the <hi>Barrowiſts</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues confeſſe, that as they were giuen by princes, ſo they may be taken away by them. To adhere to them that are great, ſo that we helpe them in truth, &amp; do not for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peruert the truth, hath no diſpraiſe but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation. In a good <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> gouernment, if we be linked one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by many dueties, it is the ſafer: and if the liuings be of the prince and lawes, then may the prince &amp; lawes vnite or ſeuer them in ſome moderate ſort, ſo that the dueties to the people be perfourmed.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the chiefe crimes which they lay againſt vs. In all this there is nothing of falſe doctrine in any matter of ſaluation, in any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our faith, but all is of things that are cleane without vs, and our miniſterie: our names, our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in, our maintenance, our depending vpon great men, and the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of more in labor, &amp; taking leſſe in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor then pertaineth (as they thinke) vnto vs. Yet this is one of their maine grounds, for which they depart &amp; forſake our Churches,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18839:81"/>euen our falſe and <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> miniſtery as they call it. But theſe things either are no crimes, or be not ſuch as therfore can make vs no miniſters. Theſe things being ſo, I may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that our miniſtery is not a denying of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophetical office of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> but rather it doth bring the fruit &amp; benefit therof vnto vs. So then we deny neither his kingdome, nor prieſthood, nor prophecy, but in a true maner &amp; great meaſure haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; their fruit among vs. God grant that they may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue with vs, and that the benefite may be much more large and plentifull to all the people.</p>
            <p>The ſixt note which they ſet vpon the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church is, that the people of one church muſt be knit together as members of one body. So they gather firſt out of <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaith,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.12.</note> 
               <hi>As the bodie is one &amp; hath many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, &amp; al the members of the body which is one, though they be many yet are one body, ſo is Chriſt.</hi> They grow into one body, &amp; are moſt neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knit together, which pertaine to Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and are ſpiritually vnited vnto <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The reſt are ioyned in an outward profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo are (after a ſort &amp; to our account) of the bodie. And thus are we one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in this land. Secondly they gather it out of <hi>Peter</hi> when he writeth:
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>To whome ye come as to a liuing ſtone, and yee as liuely ſtones
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18839:81"/>be made a ſpirituall houſe.</hi> The godlie are in deed liuing ſtones, and are made a ſpirituall houſe: the reſt, becauſe they are among them, for the outward profeſſion are ſo accounted. Nowe let vs ſee what vnitie neceſſarie to Gods Church we want. They ſay that we are not knit together as members, into one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but that men runne and goe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and depart, at their pleaſure, when they will, whither they will, as they will themſelues. What? would they haue vs euery one to keepe in one place ſtill? Or would they haue vs to aſſemble to godly exerciſes, with none but the ſame perſons continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſuch as are wel knowne to vs to be bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? This they ſeeme to meane: for they condemne the aſſemblies at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſſe, and at the common Churches in the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and of ſuch ſolemne places. But this imagination is abſurd, and the places of ſcripture conclude no ſuch thing. In ſome reſpect it is meete that euery man ſhould keepe him to his owne congregation. But if deſire of inſtruction, or other occaſion ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him to any other place of exerciſe, there he is not as it were out of ioynt, as though he could no where doe good nor receiue good, but in his owne congregation. A hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer may be a profitable hearer any where, &amp; a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18839:82"/>preacher may preach with fruit in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. God hath not tied any man ſo to one particular congregation, but at another time he may haue the ſame or another place in another aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are of the ſame body wherſoeuer they aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble: for it is the word, &amp; faith, &amp; the ſpirit, which do make vs <hi>one body,</hi> &amp; theſe are the ſame in euery place amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Gods people. Wherfore it is an abſurd collection &amp; nothing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind of <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man ſhould be ſo tied to one congregation, that he cannot fruitfully be in another. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to ſpiritual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes ſometimes in this place &amp; ſometimes in that, breaketh not the vnitie of the bodie of Chriſt. Another thing againſt the vnitie of the Church is as they ſuppoſe, that we liue in continuall diſcord, and vnpeaceable debate among our ſelues. They accuſe vs of debate, which are the cauſe of al the diſcord that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs. For about theſe things which they wold bring in, &amp; about their miſliking of the preſent ſtate, is al the diſcord. If diſcord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the church, where became their church, when <hi>Browne</hi> and <hi>Hariſon</hi> their two leaders fel out? The Apoſtles diſſented, the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had diuers ſects: if we keepe vnity in the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, diſſention in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inferiour points, will not be ſo dangerous, but yet we muſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18839:82"/>ſtriue to agree in all things, albeit we cannot hope to obtaine it. For that was neuer rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in anie Church long together: And the voice of <hi>Paul</hi> is knowen: <hi>there muſt be hereſies.</hi> Theſe <hi>Barrowiſts</hi> in diuerſe thinges ſlip and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to poperie, when they would ſeeme to bee fartheſt from it. Vnitie and conſent they make a note of their Church, euen as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes doe.</p>
            <p>In their ſeuenth note, they ouerrunne and ouerturne all the officers of our Church at a breath. They ſaye, the true Churches muſt bee gouerned by ſuch officers as <hi>Christ</hi> hath appointed to his Church. The officers that they thinke euerie Church ſhoulde haue by <hi>Chriſts</hi> appointment, are fiue: Paſtors, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Elders, Deacons, and Releeuers. Theſe they make to be neceſſarie in euerie congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or elſe that there can bee no eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Church without them. Two officers they appoint in euerie congregation for the teaching of the worde: Paſtors for exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Teachers for doctrine, and matters of controuerſie. It were to bee wiſhed, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Church had one well learned and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for both theſe partes: for maners and life, to note and correct ſwearers, idle perſons, drunckardes, and all offenders, and to order euerie thing in the Church, with the Paſtor
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18839:83"/>and teacher: they appoint Eders in no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number. The rebuke and correction of anie ſinne, we account neceſſarie, &amp; is done among vs by ſundrie kindes of officers: the paſtors by worde, the Eccleſiaſtical iudges by cenſures, the other officers by puniſhments inflicted. The thing it ſelfe we haue, as we haue the worde taught and ſet forth among vs. The third thing in gouernement that they count neceſſarie, is the Deaconſhippe, whoſe office ſhoulde bee to make collection, and to diſtribute to the poore and needie. This in euerie pariſh is done, although by officers of other names. Laſt of all, they adde Releeuers, which ſhoulde attend vpon the lame and ſicke, and ſuch as can not helpe themſelues. There is not in euerie pariſh continuall neede of ſuch a ſtanding officer. When it needeth, ſome that are charitable and pitifull, doe take ſome order for it. Now therefore the things, as being neceſſarie, for the being or for the ornament of a <hi>Christian</hi> people, we haue among vs: yet all the ſtrife in the land, is eſpecially to bring in this gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. we muſt haue a change of all, that theſe Elders and Deacons may be brought into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie pariſh. This is their <hi>Helena</hi> that they fight for. The places that are vrged for the Elderſhippe in the olde Teſtament, are theſe:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18839:83"/>Firſt out of <hi>Leuiticus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuit. 10.10.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord ſpake to Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and his ſonnes ſaying, yee ſhall not drinke wine nor ſtrongdrinke, that ye may put difference betweene the holie and vnholie, and betweene the cleane and vncleane.</hi> This helpeth not an Elderſhippe, but rather eſtabliſheth an <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 17.8.</note> An Elderſhip of laie men it can not ſet vp: For <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes were <hi>Prieſtes.</hi> The next is out of <hi>Deuteronomie: If there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie matter of plea, thou ſhalt come vnto the prieſts of the Leuites, and vnto the iudge that ſhal be in thoſe dayes.</hi> And againe: <hi>that man that will not hearken to the Prieſt, or the Iudge, that man ſhal die.</hi> This likewiſe doth ouerthrowe the laie presbyterie, and by proportion and like equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, eſtabliſheth the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> and the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of the <hi>Prince.</hi> And laſt of all,
<note place="margin">2. Chro. 19 2.</note> that in the <hi>Chronicles</hi> maye warrant an hie commiſſion for the whole land, but not a presbyterie for euerie pariſh. Thus it ſayeth: <hi>Moreouer in Ieruſalem did Iehoſhaphat ſet of the Leuites, and of the Priestes, and of the chiefe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of Iſrael for the iudgement and cauſe of the Lorde, and they returned to Ieruſalem.</hi> This was generall for the whole kingdome, and will not helpe to erect a presbyterie in euerie pariſh. The places of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are theſe: The firſt out of <hi>Matthew:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 18.17.</note> 
               <hi>If he wil not heare them, tell the Church.</hi> If <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he ſpake this, had relation to the ſtate of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18839:84"/>the <hi>Iewes:</hi> hee might meane the generall <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrion</hi> at <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> for particular they had not. If the ſtate of the Church to come be vnderſtoode: then either the gouernors in what forme ſoeuer it ſhall bee, or elſe the whole bodie of the Church, may be meant: but an Elderſhip of laie perſons, can not anie waye bee inferred of wordes ſo generall. Another place is in the Epiſtle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.4.</note> 
               <hi>when yee are gathered together:</hi> by which wordes, the whole Church is meant, and not anie laie Elders. For hee ſpeaketh to them that were <hi>puffed vp,</hi> and ſhoulde haue ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and thoſe were not Elders onely, if there were anie in the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> and it is manifeſt that he writeth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Church. And out of the Epiſtle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> they would fetch an vnteaching Elderſhip, when hee ſayeth,
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.14.</note> 
               <hi>deſpiſe not the gift which is giuen thee by propheſie, with the laying on of the hands of Elderſhip.</hi> This presbyterie, or Elderſhip, <hi>Caluine</hi> ſayeth, maye be meant of the office which hee receaued to bee an Elder, that is, a Miniſter of the worde, and not of anie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, by whome he receaued it. And how ſhoulde wee thinke, that the laying on of handes to make a Miniſter, ſhoulde pertaine to them that are no Miniſters? After theſe particular places for their Elderſhip, they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18839:84"/>haue ſome alſo which ſeeme to inferre theſe, and all their other officers: but the chiefe are two. The firſt is to the <hi>Romanes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.6.</note> 
               <hi>Seeing then that we haue giftes that are diuerſe, according to the grace that is giuen vnto vs, whether we haue propheſie, let vs prophecy according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith: or an office, let vs waite on the office: or he that teacheth on teaching: or he that exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on exhortation: he that diſtributeth, let him do it with ſimplicitie: he that ruleth, with dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: he that ſheweth mercie, with cherefulnes:</hi> hence they will ſeeme to fetch all their officers. But this, none of the ancient fathers, none of the learned writers of our time did ſee, till of late. This ſeemeth not exactlie to agree to their plot: for firſt here are three names for doctrine: Propheſie, Teaching, and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: and all maye bee performed by one man. Then to <hi>Rule,</hi> and to haue an <hi>Office</hi> are ſo generall, that they can not bee reſtrained to the forme and name of ſuch Elders as they appoint. To diſtribute, and to ſhewe mercie, either pertaine to all: or elſe, if there muſt be ſuch officers, it is not neceſſarie vnder their names of Deacons, and Releeuers, nor at all times: but as time &amp; occaſions require. Their other place is to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.28.</note> 
               <hi>God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ſome in the Church, as firſt Apoſtles, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly Prophets, thirdly Teachers, then them
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18839:85"/>that doe miracles, after that the giftes of healing, helpers, gouerners, diuerſitie of tongues.</hi> Here are more then fiue: and by no direct waye can theſe preciſely bee hence fetched. <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Teachers, diuerſitie of tongues</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all eſpeciallie to doctrine. The <hi>gift of working miracles,</hi> and of <hi>healing,</hi> were but for thoſe times: <hi>Helpers,</hi> and <hi>gouerners</hi> are too large names, to bring in onely Deacons, and Relieuers, and Elders, into euerie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, in ſuch ſort and order as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. <hi>Gouernors</hi> wee haue, and <hi>helpers,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee haue not their Elders nor their Deacons. Theſe are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe places, whereon their diſcipline is builded. Other they haue in the <hi>Actes,</hi> and to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and <hi>Timothie,</hi> and <hi>Titus:</hi> but none of them make the whole number, nor the particulars in their forme, and eſpecially (which is the chiefe) they helpe not their Elderſhippe of vnteaching perſons. Now then, wee may haue <hi>Chriſts</hi> gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſeeke his kingdome, although wee haue not theſe officers, in theſe names, and this order.</p>
            <p>Their newe officers are not neceſſarie to the building of the Churche: but peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they whome we haue, doe pull downe the Church. That is their opinion: for thus they ſpeake of our eſtate: <hi>In ſteade of theſe,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18839:85"/>they remaine moſt ſeruilely ſubiect to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian gouernement of the popiſh Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Byſhops, Chauncelors, Archdeacons, Deanes, Commiſſaries, Doctors, Proctors, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocates, Notaries, Regiſters, Purſeuants, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetors, Summoners: and from the Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſeate of the Byſhops, they receaue as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and falſe a Miniſterie, as their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Vicars, Curates, Hirelings, Lecturers, Mercenarie preachers: All which together, with this people, ſtand bounde and ſubiect to the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Romiſh courtes of hie commiſſion, of facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of arches, of prerogatiues, of delegates, of their Commiſſaries, and the reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe wee haue ſome officers of like name, though not all, nor of like quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as they childiſhlie imagine: They ſaye, neither gouerners nor ſubiectes, neither pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors nor people, can bee the Churche of <hi>Christ.</hi> Foure orders they make here of thinges and perſons to bee condemned and remoued. Firſt, all thoſe that haue Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall gouernement committed vnto them, the <hi>Byſhops</hi> and all that doe aſſiſt them. Secondlie, all ſortes of Miniſters, preachers and not preachers. Thirdly, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall courts and iudgements. Laſt of all, the whole people for being and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſubiect vnto thoſe. If we aske a reaſon
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18839:86"/>of this their peremptorie ſentence, wee can perceaue none here, but becauſe they are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and Antichriſtian. If I ſhoulde confeſſe this, and ſaye the gouernement is ſuch, and defende our Church, by the example of the Church in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as one doeth: I ſhoulde iuſtifie them, and condemne our ſelues: I ſhoulde lye againſt the trueth, and againſt mine owne ſoule. But thus I ſaye: If theſe thinges be popiſh, as they doe ſtand among vs, let them bee excluded: naye let vs bee excluded out of the Church altogether. Nowe then, how ſhall we knowe, whether a thing be popiſh and <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> or no? By the names? that can not be: Names of their nature be indifferent: the thinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the names, as they are vſed of vs, muſt be examined. And how ſhall we finde, whether they bee popiſh and <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?</hi> If they ſerue to promote poperie, then are they popiſh, then are they <hi>Antichriſtian:</hi> But if they further <hi>Chriſts</hi> glorie, &amp; his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: then may they bee retained in the Church of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and we hauing them, bee his Church. Therefore, if none of theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor courtes, nor Miniſters helpe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine idolatrie, or the Popes ſupremacie, or mens traditions againſt the written worde: or free wil againſt the grace of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> or mens
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18839:86"/>merites againſt iuſtification by faith, or the Idole and ſacrifice of the Maſſe, or pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, or purgatorie, or prayer for the dead, or auricular confeſſion, or ſatisfactions for ſinnes by penance, or indulgences, or the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the worde of God from the people in an vnknowen tongue, or ſuch like: if they doe not maintaine vice, nor iniuſtice, nor he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie among vs, but are directed to roote out poperie, to keepe vs in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true faith, to aduance the worde of God, to eſtabliſh our iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith, to further repentance and good workes, to puniſh ſinne, to define that which is equall and right, to keepe the common peace of the Churche: then are they not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, ſeeing they are bent and exerciſed to the ruine of poperie: but they are <hi>Christian</hi> and holie, and appertaining to the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for as much as they further the kingdome and glorie of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Sauiour. All that are zealous, ſtriue for two thinges, wherein all men are to put to their helpe by counſel, by credite, by authoritie, by power, and by all lawfull meanes that bee in them. One, that the worde of God maye bee more diligently, and commonly taught: the other, that ſinne may bee more ſeuerely and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally puniſhed. If theſe two may by this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement bee more ſet forwarde, much of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:18839:87"/>theſe troubles and contentions will be eaſier ſtopped. There is no fault in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> names, or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offices, but they may helpe forward theſe or any good things. Wherfore they be not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie popiſh, or Antichriſtian: but in the abuſe they were, in the right vſe they are now holie &amp; Chriſtianlike. Now let vs ſee what ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth condemne theſe names and offices. Two places are brought out againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: One out of the Pſalme: <hi>The kings of the earth band themſelues, and the princes are aſſembled together againſt the Lord, and against his Chriſt: let vs breake their bands, and caſt their cords from vs.</hi> But do our gouerners &amp; all the people in this eſtate, band themſelues againſt the Lord, and againſt his <hi>Chriſt?</hi> doe they not band them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for the glorie of the Lorde and of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt?</hi> It might be done I knowe more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifullie, yet this gouernement ſetteth forth <hi>Chriſt</hi> onely to vs, with his benefits to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Chriſts</hi> deitie, <hi>Chriſts</hi> goſpel, <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>Chriſts</hi> iuſtice, <hi>Chriſts</hi> kingdome by this is aduanced. Wherefore they band not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> neither do they ſay, let vs breake their bands, &amp; caſt their cordes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, but rather they willinglie receaue the bands, yea the chaines of <hi>Chriſt</hi> if neede be. We are conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that his lawe binde our feete, &amp; hands, &amp; eyes, and hearts alſo: but we caſt off their
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18839:87"/>bands, becauſe we caſt away their gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Elders. They are not the bandes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are but ſmall threeds, that wil ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily bee broken.
<note place="margin">Luke 19.14.</note> The other place which they alleage againſt thoſe titles &amp; offices is in <hi>Luke Now his citizens hated him, and ſent an embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage after him, ſaying, we wil not haue this man to reigne ouer vs.</hi> Theſe places that were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the obſtinate <hi>Iewes,</hi> that hated y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name &amp; faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of the heathen idolaters, that worſhipped falſe Gods, and would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Christ</hi> to be God, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Mahometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> ſect that reiect <hi>Chriſts</hi> goſpel, &amp; denie his rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, of the Antichriſtian &amp; popiſh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which keepe his name, and denie his effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie &amp; ſufficiencie in redeeming vs; thoſe (I ſaye) they bring againſt them that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all which they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues doe for ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for infalliblenes of his truth, and for all his benefites, onelie becauſe wee yeeld not to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for a certaine forme of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gouernment. But they muſt proue more euidentlie, that thoſe thinges are euill, or elſe we will not be terrified by thoſe places, but that we may ſafelie ſay, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> true Church of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is with vs euen in this gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
            <p>To returne againe to their other notes which remaine, whereby they will deſcribe a viſible church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they ſay, that <hi>Chriſts</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:18839:88"/>Church muſt be gouerned by his own lawes, take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the olde &amp; newe Teſtament, and no other. They thinke, as it ſeemeth, that no lawes neede more to be made for any thing, but that the lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhoulde ſtand, &amp; be ſufficient to determine all matters: Or if for ciuil matters they will admit more, yet for puniſhments in matters Eccleſiaſticall, it is certaine they will acknowledge no more, nor anie other. Their groundes for this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are theſe ſcriptures. Firſt out of Saint <hi>Matthewe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 17.5.</note> 
               <hi>This is my beloued ſonne, heare him.</hi> It extendeth to matters of doctrine and ſaluation, and all that hee hath taught: but not to matters of gouernement Ciuill, or Eccleſiaſticall in particular: For hee hath not made ſuch lawes. The next is out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 3.6.</note> 
               <hi>Hee is Lorde of the houſe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.16.</note> therefore hee is to bee obeyed, in ſo much as hee hath ſet downe. Particular ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces he hath not preſcribed for gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but left it free. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they bring this out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians: We haue the minde of Chriſt:</hi> hee meaneth for matters of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and the worſhip of God: but not for particular actions that muſt be conſidered in gouernement. After this, commeth that to the <hi>Galathians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.15.</note> 
               <hi>A mans teſtament, when it is confirmed, no man doth abrogate,</hi> or addeth to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18839:88"/>it. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of iuſtification by faith, whereto, works as a cauſe of iuſtification muſt not be added: nothing there of outward go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement. Now as for their other places,
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.13.</note> they inferre not, that in the worde are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lawes ſet downe for all thinges: but that ſuch as are commanded, ſhould be obſerued: as that to <hi>Timothie: I charge thee that thou keep the commandement without ſpot, and vnrebukea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vntil the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> That which <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſet downe as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to be kept, or hath ſo declared, that muſt be kept for euer. But who can ſaye, that <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſet downe lawes for all things in that Epiſtle?
<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.11.</note> And that to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> doth not conclude their purpoſe: <hi>Hee hath giuen Apostles for the worke of the Miniſterie, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of the Saintes, til we all meete to a perfect man.</hi> This place ſpeaketh onelie of doctrine, and not of lawes for gouernement either in the Church, or common-wealth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they thinke their Paſtors and Doctors muſt make lawes for al things. And as for that to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.37.</note> cutteth not off al lawes for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church made by men: <hi>If any man thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a prophet, or ſpiritual, let him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the things which I write vnto you, are the commandements of the Lorde.</hi> He writeth there, of not vſing ſtrange languages, where
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18839:89"/>they are not vnderſtood, and and of women, that they ſhould not preach in the Church. But there are other thinges which by lawes muſt be ordered, which <hi>Paul,</hi> nor the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture anie where hath determined in ſpeciall. Laſt of all, they applie to this purpoſe, all thoſe places of ſcripture, which teach that nothing muſt bee added nor taken from the worde of God. The making of lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout orders in gouernement, is no addition to Gods worde: For the thing is not there forbidden. Thus they will ſeeme to proue, that in the worde are ſufficient lawes to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mens actions: vpon this grounde, they will haue the penall lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi> reuiued: then they muſt bring vs againe to the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> they muſt eſtabliſh to vs againe that kingdome: For thoſe penall lawes like as the ceremoniall, were proper onely to that people. <hi>Now the Prieſthoode being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the lawe is changed.</hi> As they ſaye, the worde hath ſufficient lawes to determine all thinges: ſo likewiſe, they will not admitte that princes ſhoulde make lawes, thereby to helpe forwarde the kingdome of <hi>Christ.</hi> For they ſaye the kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not by the lawes of men, but by the worde and ſpirite. For this purpoſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe theſe ſcriptures. Firſt, that of Saint
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18839:89"/>
               <hi>Luke:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. 17.20.</note> 
               <hi>The kingdome of God commeth not with obſeruation:</hi> They meane with obſeruing princes lawes: but <hi>Chriſt</hi> meaneth that his kingdome commeth not, neither is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by outwarde pompe and worldlie glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which the <hi>Phariſes</hi> looked for: but is properlie a thing inwarde in the heart. That place nothing pertaineth to outward lawes. Alſo they miſapplie that of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie: Neither by an armie nor ſtrength,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 4.6.</note> 
               <hi>but by my ſpirite, ſaieth the Lorde of hoſtes.</hi> This is ſpoken by compariſon, that God in the preſeruing of his Churche vſeth principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the working of his ſpirite, and not an armie, nor ſtrength of men: Yet that hee vſeth armies, and ſtrength for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the Churche in all ages hath had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. But the principall is his ſpirite: outwarde ſtrength and lawes in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, and without it are nothing. When <hi>Eſaie</hi> ſayeth: <hi>Beholde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſaie 40.10.</note> 
               <hi>the Lorde God will come with power, and his arme ſhall rule for him:</hi> his arme ruleth, euen by the good and wholeſome lawes of men.
<note place="margin">Iere. 17.5.</note> And that curſe in <hi>Ieremie</hi> pertaineth not to vs, becauſe we are ruled by lawes of princes. <hi>Thus ſayeth the Lorde, Curſed bee the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſhe his arme, and withdraweth his heart from the Lorde:</hi> For we
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18839:90"/>truſt not in the lawes of princes, nor in them, when we vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder God for our quiet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement: we knowe that <hi>Kings are nurſing fathers, and Queenes are nurſing mothers. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Ioſaphat,</hi> and <hi>Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Ioſias,</hi> and all godlie princes made lawes for the Churche of God, and were approued: yea, the lawes &amp; decrees of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> were for the behoofe &amp; benefite of it. Manie thinges are left vndeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in ſpeciall, wherein princes make good and profitable decrees for the Churche. If their poſition were true, the Prophets, and our Sauiour ſhoulde not haue condemned either the princes, or the lawiers for making vniuſt lawes, but for making anie lawes at all. Princes eſpecially ſerue <hi>Chriſt,</hi> euen in making lawes for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not, that ſufficient lawes in ſpeciall, are ſet downe in the worde for the Churche: nor that it is wicked for the Church, to vſe the lawes of princes, and to bee ſubiect to them, if otherwiſe they bee not vngodly. Nowe marke what they ſaye of our lawes: <hi>Wee</hi> (they ſaye) <hi>are not gouerned by the worde of God, but by Canons, Iniunctions, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, of theſe Antichriſtian and Popiſh courts.</hi> Let them name one Canon, or Decree and Iniunction, that maintaineth anie thing that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18839:90"/>is popiſh or againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſurely it ought to be aboliſhed. But there be lawes which they had, which came not from them, but either from the word of God, or the light of nature, or former holy conſtitutions. Why ſhould their detaining of them in vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, hinder vs from the conuerting of them to the furtherance of the Goſpell? They are not popiſh ſo long as they are not directed to maintaine poperie, but are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to godlineſſe and peace, in obedience of the trueth.</p>
            <p>The ninth marke of their Church is, that al and ech one of them muſt ſtand in and for their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> libertie, to practiſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God hath commanded, and is reuealed vnto them in his holy word. This their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is one of the chiefe points wherein they ſtand. Here neither Prince, nor Counſellour, nor Byſhop, nor Law muſt reſtraine them, from refuſing or caſting off whatſoeuer they miſlike, or from taking vpon them and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in practiſe any thing that they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and concluded to be done. Seeing according to their conceit, they haue found out that Byſhops and all other officers in our Church are popiſh, and that the miniſtery beareth (as they ſuppoſe) popiſh names and markes, and the lawes are popiſh, they will
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18839:91"/>neither ſue to Prince nor Counſell for the remouing of any of theſe things, but with all ſpeede caſt the yoke from their owne necks. And ſeeing they haue found in their fanſies, that an elderſhippe and no other lawes but the written word is to be heard, therefore they will erect theſe things among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For God (ſay they) hath left power in euery man and euery aſſembly of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to caſt off al that may hinder, &amp; to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to any thing that may further their ſaluation. In matters neceſſary to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we graunt there is by Gods gracious working ſuch freedome giuen to Gods people, that all the deuils in hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder them from hauing that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſhould be brought to paſſe. But ſuch are not the things, which they ſtriue for. Saluation may be had in this ſtate without them. But their opinion of vs in reſpect of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> libertie is this. They ſay, that <hi>all wee remaine in bondage to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian and Babyloniſh yokes, yeelding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to theſe Courts and their Cannons.</hi> Now let vs heare their ſcripture, by which they will maintaine their ſo abſolute libertie, and condemne vs as men in <hi>Egyptian</hi> bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. The places are theſe: firſt that to the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.9.</note> 
               <hi>But now ſeeing ye know God, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18839:91"/>are knowen of God, howe turne ye againe to impotent and beggerlie rudiments, whereunto as from the beginning, you will be in bondage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? Paul</hi> there ſpeaketh of the obſeruation of dayes and ceremonies of the lawe with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of neceſſitie to ſaluation &amp; iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: we repoſe neither ſaluation nor iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any ceremony or outward thing which we vſe: not in the gouernment, not in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, this or that. In the vſe of them our minds are free. The like meaning hath that to the <hi>Colloſſians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Colloſ. 2.20.</note> 
               <hi>If yee bee dead with Chriſt from the ordinances of the worlde, why as though yee liued in the world, are yee burthened with traditions?</hi> There is no tradition in our Church that can be a burthen to a mans conſcience, being rightly taken, ſeeing there is no idolatrous tradition among vs, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ioyned with opinion of neceſſitie, or worſhip of God, or merite to ſaluation. But in thoſe things the ſoule is left free to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend wholly vpon <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The like meaning hath that to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.23</note> 
               <hi>Yee are bought with a price, bee not the ſeruauntes of men. Paul</hi> condemneth not obedience in things lawfull, but in volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie worſhippe. And as for vs, we place no neceſſary part of Gods worſhip in the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The booke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon praier
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18839:92"/>is not reckoned ſo neceſſary, as if God were not otherwiſe rightly worſhipped; neither yet abſolutely as meere traditions of men, for as much as it is either ſcripture, or agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto ſcripture. Outward ceremonies are retained for order, but no part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip placed either in croſſe or garment. To theſe places of ſcripture as of like nature may be ioyned that of the <hi>Actes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 4.19.</note> 
               <hi>Wee ought rather to obey God then men,</hi> that is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand things contrary. But in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or in the miniſtery, or in Gods worſhip, or in the admiſſion of men to the ſacraments, the lawes of this land doe not commaund things contrary to God, for any thing that we haue yet found. Laſt of all for our bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<note place="margin">Apoc. 14.19.</note> they produce firſt the <hi>Reuelation</hi> where it ſayeth: <hi>If any man worſhippe the beaſt or his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi> The gouernment by Byſhops, they take to be the <hi>image of the beaſt.</hi> They were (we confeſſe,) ſo to be accounted, while they maintained the Pope and his lawes: but now they are not ſo, when they are ſet to further the Goſpell and truth of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Theſe are the places by which they would conuince vs to be in bondage. But the Scriptures by which they chalenge their large and infinite liberty are theſe:
<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.33.</note> firſt that of <hi>Iohn, Ye ſhall knowe the trueth, and the trueth ſhall make you free. Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:18839:92"/>ſpeaketh of freedome, not from lawes and Magiſtrates and Eccleſiaſticall gouernment, but from ſinne and <hi>Satan:</hi> for he ſayth, <hi>He that committeth ſinne is the ſeruaunt of ſinne.</hi> The next that is pretended to ſpeake for their liberty, is <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galathians.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.6.</note> 
               <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem which is aboue is free, which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of vs all. Paul</hi> diſputeth of our freedome from the curſe of the lawe, and from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and other ceremonies, ſo that the curſe is not to be feared of vs that are made free by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor iuſtification to be ſought by the ceremonies of the lawe, nor any part of Gods worſhippe to be repoſed any longer in them. And the ſame is his purpoſe in the fift Chapter, when he ſayth, <hi>Stand faſt in the libertie wherewith Chriſt hath made vs free.</hi> This is the freedome of conſcience, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from the curſe pronounced by the lawe, and from the ceremonies thereof, with opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of worſhippe or merite of ſaluation. Thus are we free. We are vnder a gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and haue ſome fewe ceremonies: but we neither count them parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, nor any cauſe of our iuſtification or ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Thus our minds are free, although our bodies be bound in an outward obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. They may therefore become ſubiect with vs to this gouernment, and yet inioy
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18839:93"/>due <hi>Chriſtian</hi> libertie.</p>
            <p>The tenth and laſt note of their Church is this, that <hi>it muſt haue the power that Chriſt hath giuen to his Church to the worlds end, and all the powers in earth and hell cannot take from them: namely to bind and looſe, and to reforme things that are amiſſe.</hi> Which power they ſay we haue not. For our aſſemblies as they iudge, caſt out <hi>Satan</hi> by the power of <hi>Satan:</hi> namely (ſay they) <hi>by theſe impes of Antichriſt, the Byſhops, Commiſſaries, and Prieſts.</hi> Theſe be their words. Then if they ſay true in deed, in this Church gouernement we haue no binding ſinners, and looſing them that doe repent, but by the deuill. Let vs ſee what binding or looſing the church of God ſhould haue, and how farre that which we haue is wanting and diſagreeing from the trueth. The power giuen to the Church in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they affirme to beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which follow.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 149.</note> Firſt in the Pſalme when it is ſaid, <hi>To bind their Kings in chaines, &amp; their nobles in fetters of yron.</hi> This place ſeemeth properly to be vnderſtood not of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical cenſures, but of outward victory got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the ſword againſt Gods enemies by his people after their oppreſſion. This God giueth oftentimes to his Church, and hath (his name be prayſed) giuen already vnto
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18839:93"/>vs: God graunt when need ſhall require, we may obtaine it hereafter. The next place by which they chalenge this power, is in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe: If hee will not heare them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18.17</note> 
               <hi>tell it to the Church, and if hee refuſe to heare the Church alſo, let him be vnto thee as an heathen man and as a publicane.</hi> By the Church might here be vnderſtood y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernors to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be committed of the church, or els the whole aſſembly ſpeaking by the voice of one or fewe, for the declaration of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie and damnable ſtate of ſuch an one: but as for a presbyterie in euerie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation it cannot ſerue, ſeeing if it be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by relation to the practiſe of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they had no ſuch thing: but in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in one citie, one aſſemblie, one conſiſtorie of ſuch iudgement for all. After this they ſeeke ſomewhat for their excommunicating preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery in <hi>Luke.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 10.19</note> 
               <hi>Behold I giue vnto you power to treade on ſerpents and ſcorpions, and ouer all the power of the enemie, and nothing ſhall hurt you.</hi> This was a miraculous gift confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> both for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and the glorie of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> by the viper hanging on his hand receyued no hurt. The thinges going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are referred to the power of the word beating down <hi>Satan</hi> from the ſoules of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18839:94"/>men. As for excommunication or puniſhing the wicked by cenſures, this pertaineth not to that. That to the <hi>Corinths</hi> maketh the moſt ſhewe for their purpoſe, <hi>When ye are gathered together and my ſpirite by the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.4.</note> 
               <hi>let ſuch a one be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto Satan.</hi> But this maketh againſt that which they ſeeke, &amp; ſeemeth to fauour that order which we haue. For <hi>Paul</hi> being one man alone, did decree this ſentence: The Church was to declare it. But whether it be done by one or many, this needeth much heed and care and conſcience, that this ſword bee drawne againſt none, but thoſe that doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it. Laſt of all, that of the 2. <hi>Corinths,</hi> doth not helpe the presbyterie. Thus he ſayeth. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but mightie through God to caſt downe holdes, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting downe imaginations and euery hie thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captiuitie euery thought to the obedience of Chriſt, hauing readie venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt all diſobedience.</hi> A great part of this is vnderſtoode of the word preached, which worketh theſe effects. The venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt diſobedience was a thing in <hi>Paules</hi> owne hand as miniſter of it, not in the power of the multitude or any presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie there mentioned. So that if it pertaine to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18839:94"/>the cenſure of the Church, it might be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one man. But it is thought rather to be meant of bodilie puniſhment, which by the mightie power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Apoſtles in the beginning did inflict vpon the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: So <hi>Peter</hi> killed <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſtroke <hi>Elymas</hi> blind. Theſe are their authorities, whereby they chalenge to their Elderſhip, power and might to binde and looſe, and would inferre, that in the Church of <hi>England</hi> there is no caſting out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, but by the power of the diuel, becauſe their presbyterie is not called to coniure him out. Some reformed Churches vſe no excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication at all, and yet are the Churches of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> They haue other puniſhments for the offenders: The trueth is, that excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication cutteth no man from the Church, whome his owne ſinne and vnbeliefe hath not cut off before: Neither can it looſe anie, whome faith and gods ſpirite doth not looſe. Thus much of the tenth and laſt note of their Churche. Thus I haue briefelie ſet before you a ſhort viewe of the difference betwixt the <hi>Sectaries</hi> and vs. They that fauour theſe opinions, theſe innouations, are in diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: ſome ſaye they are imperfections, and wantes, and maimes in our Church, the moſt of thoſe thinges which they miſlike, but yet
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18839:95"/>to be tolerated. It muſt be confeſſed there is no Church, but hath imperfections. We may not maintaine all thinges, as blameles in our Church. No man is founde faultles: euery Church is wanting in their duetie, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of mens lawes, and of the perſons. We can not iuſtifie our ſelues in all thinges: but that euerie thing is ſuch a deformitie, and maime, or anie ſo groſſe as they ſeeme to make them, if the particulars be examined, it will not be founde. Theſe miſlikers and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerators haue begotten the laſt and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt degree of reuolters, of forſakers, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers, and plaine contemners, whoſe caſe is much to bee pitied: eſpeciallie of thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlikers, becauſe thorowe them, they are come into this downefal. The controuerſies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee differ, haue ſmall weight in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and leſſe in the proofes, yet beholde the concluſion.</p>
            <p>Thus they ſpeake. <hi>Therefore the pariſhes of England are not, and for all theſe reaſons ſeuerall and ioyned, cannot bee helde in anie Chriſtians iudgement, the true Churches of Chriſt.</hi> This is their ſentence vpon all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and people in this land, that come to the Churches, that heare the worde at our mouthes, that receaue the Sacraments at our handes: they ſhut vp all in one ſtate of not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18839:95"/>being the people of God, nor the Churche of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As for our ſelues, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their raſh iudgement, wee knowe vpon what grounde wee ſtand. <hi>There can no other foundation bee layde, then that which is layde, euen Ieſus Chriſt is the head corner ſtone, he is the rocke:</hi> Euerie pariſh in this land is taught, either plentifullie, or ſparinglie: yet all are taught this, that <hi>Christ</hi> onely is our head, our ſacrifice, our righteouſnes, that hee is to bee laide holde on onelie by faith ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with repentaunce, and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Where this is taught, and receaued, there is the Churche of God. All the pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes in this land bee taught it, and by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like confeſſion doe witneſſe that outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, at leaſt, they doe receaue it. The Lorde graunt that it maye bee made more cleare, and that it maye bee whetted more ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon all, and that all maye receaue it fruitefullie, to comfort and ſaluation.
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth: <hi>Proue your ſelues, whether you are in the faith, examine your ſelues, knowe yee not your ſelues, how that Ieſus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We neede not be caſt in doubt of our ſelues, for a ſuppoſed appendant trueth of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forme of gouernement, as though if we haue not that, and yet haue the truth of faith,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18839:96"/>the ſpirite of <hi>Christ,</hi> the worde of God, the ſacraments of the Goſpell, repentaunce and newenes of life: hauing theſe (I ſay) that are moſt neceſſarie and ſubſtantiall branches of Chriſtian religion; it were madnes to thinke wee haue nothing, becauſe they imagine wee haue ſome as bad, or worſe then infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and heathen men among vs, and becauſe we haue not ſuch an outwarde gouernement as pleaſeth them, becauſe we worſhip God by the booke of Common prayer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Miniſters ſome are not preachers, and all are made by the Byſhops, and all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate or allowe the booke of Common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the outwarde gouernement. Theſe are the chiefe heades of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them &amp; vs. While men ſeeke to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Churches, they will bring to paſſe, that there will bee among vs no Church at all. Now with vs, there is leaue for all men to be good, if they will by Gods grace indeuour. They would haue it ſo as they fancie, that no man ſhould be euill: but this is impoſſible. If we can bring to paſſe, that the Goſpell be taught in all places, and that ſinnes bee moſt ſeuerelie puniſhed, and all be brought to the learning of the worde of God: then ſhall we ſee a more perfect and beautifull forme of the Church among vs. Thus many of theſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18839:96"/>controuerſies will be appeaſed, then ſhal we moſt clearelie appeare to bee the <hi>armie</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and hee will ſhewe himſelfe to be our captaine, and Lorde, and God. Thus much to them that denie that we are <hi>Chriſts armie,</hi> and that our Churches as they now ſtand, are not the true Churches of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This matter being thus runne ouer, it is time to returne to that which wee haue in hand. <hi>The beaſt, and the kings of the earth and their armies, fight against him that ſitteth on the horſe, and againſt his armie.</hi> A parte of this armie, the Churche of <hi>England</hi> as it ſtandeth nowe is, by the ſingular goodnes of God. All Gods people make but one armie, and that an vnited armie. How much more then is it neceſſary, that we which be but one band as it were, of this mightie armie, ſhould agree together in one? Let all lay aſide en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, pride, and aemulation. Let vs eſpecially now in the time of ſo dangerous threatnings, and attempts of the enemies, put away ſtrife about theſe matters. Many doubtleſſe ſtirre vp, and ſet a fire the parties on both ſides, and yet beare no loue to eyther. It were the beſt meanes of the enemies victorie, to increaſe ſtrife. <hi>Cyprian</hi> aſcribeth the violent perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that came vpon the Church in his time vnder <hi>Decius,</hi> to diſſenſion, which fell among

Thus hee ſayeth: <hi>Postquam res noſtrae, &amp;c. After our eſtate by too much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hiſt. l. 8. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>degenerated into nicenes and ſluggiſhnes, and one hated and reuiled another, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it happened, wee among our ſelues, and by our ſelues, did ſet vpon one another with armour
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18839:97"/>and weapons of wordes, and rulers fell out with ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and paſtors with paſtors, and people moued ſedition againſt people, and after this vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hypocriſie and mocking, did growe to the top of malice and naughtines: Gods iudgement (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his accuſtomed maner) came vpon the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> This was the eſtate in the time of <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> before the perſecution came. Ours is not much vnlike. God graunt diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ceaſe, that there follow not the like euent. The ſeueritie of ſome men in maintaining vnity is miſliked: but there is nothing but ſeueritie can helpe vs. <hi>Abbas Vrſpergenſis</hi> by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſchiſme in <hi>Germanie</hi> about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> election of the Emperor, ſome leaning to <hi>Philip,</hi> ſome to <hi>Berthold,</hi> ſome to <hi>Otto,</hi> ſaith: <hi>that there was not one pariſh which agreed with another, &amp; that by occaſion of this, &amp; ſuch ſtrifes, the Pope did grow ſo great. Iocu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dare ſuper adiutrice tua diſcordia, quia erupit de puteo infernalis abiſſi, vt accumule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur tibi multa pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praemia.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18839:98"/>made the Pope great, and brought his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie vppon them. That alſo was the cauſe of Gods iudgementes vpon the Eaſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: the diſſention about the <hi>Trinitie</hi> made a way for <hi>Mahomet.</hi> If any thing will bring the <hi>Antichristian</hi> yoke vpon this lande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine (which God turne far from vs) it will be diſſention. Therefore all bitternes, and libelling, and ſlaundering muſt bee layde away.</p>
            <p>If it might come to paſſe that wee were an vnited <hi>armie,</hi> then we might eaſilie hope to ſtand, we might preuaile againſt our enemies, although they came neuer ſo manie, or ſo oft againſt vs. To bring vs to vnitie, and to helpe vs to get the victorie againſt the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, wee haue neede of manie meanes. Theſe cauſes that are in controuerſie muſt be opened by preaching, by writing, by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. So <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſtopped the mouthes of the <hi>Donatiſtes,</hi> that are moſt like to thoſe with whome wee haue to deale. After this maner, he oft ouercame the <hi>Maniches,</hi> and the <hi>Palagians, Zwinglius</hi> by diſputing, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and preaching, draue the <hi>Anabaptiſtes</hi> cleane out of <hi>Zurich,</hi> although there they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. If ſectaries write, and no man anſwere: if they priuelie ſowe the ſeede of their ſecte, and no man publikely roote it out: they will
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18839:98"/>ouergrowe all. While Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> liued, his aunſwering and confuting of euerie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Treatiſe, which came forth in Engliſh, did much good in keeping away from vs the infection and poyſon of Poperie. Able men ſhoulde bee choſen (if they offer not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,) which ſhould continue that courſe, that nothing might appeare againſt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or gouernement, which ſhoulde not be aunſwered. If they can not be aunſwered, let the faultes be amended, let them not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. This is one meanes to helpe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer vnitie.</p>
            <p>Another helpe muſt be in the ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, which by authoritie and puniſhment, muſt reſtraine the libertie of rayling, of libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and of contemning the gouernours in place. Vile pamphlets of reproch and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhould not be ſuffered to goe forth: no, not againſt an enemie. While we ſuffer one parte to rayle, wee prouoke the other, and peraduenture a third commeth in, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth both in the fouleſt colours. Theſe ſhould be meanes to vnite vs at home.</p>
            <p>Againſt our common enemies, wee had neede firſt to be armed with innocencie and righteouſnes: we muſt beare the colours of our captaine <hi>Ieſus Chriſt: Hee rideth vpon a white horſe;</hi> and the warriours which were in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18839:99"/>heauen, by hope and conuerſation followed him <hi>vpon white horſes clothed with fine linnen, white &amp; pure.</hi> And before in this Chapter it is ſayde, that the <hi>white linnen is the righteouſnes of Saintes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If wee be knowen by theſe colours, our captaine and generall will not ſuffer vs to be ouerrunne. <hi>Nineue</hi> repented, and after threatning was ſaued. God hath generallie promiſed to anie nation repenting, that hee will turne away the euill which hee hath deuiſed againſt it. Wee can not but ſee the land full of ſinne: Contention and ſtrife in the Miniſters, and a great parte of the people: Theftes, robberies, murders neuer ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, nor with ſuch multitudes and boldnes attempted: Whoredome, exceſſe, pride, and drunkenneſſe ouerflowe all. Theſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie ragges muſt bee caſt away, and wee muſt put vpon vs the fine <hi>white linnen of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs not thinke that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ten will ſaue our land, as it would haue ſaued <hi>Sodome.</hi> God hath not made ſuch a generall condition with all people: and there is no compariſon betweene fiue little cities in a valley, and all this lande. When the captiuitie was brought vpon <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> there were diuers that feared God
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18839:99"/>among them. The righteous man ſhall eſcape himſefe in the time of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Hee ſhall not ſaue anie other: God will prouide for thoſe that are his, liuing, or dying. <hi>If Noah, Iob, and Daniel were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong this people, As I liue ſayeth the Lorde, they ſhould ſaue neither ſonne nor daughter: they ſhould ſaue but their owne ſoules.</hi> Euerie man labour to bee righteous himſelfe, and hee ſhall bee ſafe. Remember that <hi>Chriſt</hi> iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and fighteth righteouſly.</p>
            <p>To this righteouſnes of life, wee muſt alſo ioyne faith, or rather righteouſneſſe muſt bee ioyned to faith. <hi>This is our vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie that ouercommeth the worlde, euen our faith. By faith Dauid, Gedeon, and the reſt ſubdued kingdomes, and wrought deliuerance to Gods people.</hi> Although wee haue ſinne, yet let vs repent and truſt in Gods mercie and power, and commit the euent to him. Faith preuaileth with God by prayer. By prayer, <hi>Moſes</hi> fought againſt <hi>Amalek: Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> by prayer obteyned fire to conſume the fiftie that came to take him. Prayer deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Ezechias,</hi> when <hi>Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib</hi> was readie to deuoure them. Theſe muſt be our ſpirituall armour. Theſe muſt we put on as Chriſtians: and as men, we muſt arme
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18839:100"/>our ſelues if neede require otherwiſe. It is needefull that we ſhould alwayes be readie. <hi>The beaſt</hi> will not change his nature: His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourer is mightie and impatient of a foyle. Let vs not bee ſecure, becauſe God hath fought for vs, and giuen vs one victorie. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> at his firſt comming into this land, had the repulſe. The <hi>Danes</hi> were at the firſt beaten backe. The <hi>Gothes</hi> at their firſt comming into <hi>Italie</hi> with three hundred thouſand were ouerthrowne: but within fiue yeares after they came againe, and deſtroyed all the Weſt Empire. The <hi>Saraſens</hi> at the firſt, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and drowned with tempeſt comming into <hi>Spayne:</hi> but at length they tooke it, and inhabited it certaine hundred yeeres. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> was not wonne at the firſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt it. It is not in vaine, that God bringeth enemies againſt a people, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth them once or twiſe. It is not to make them proude nor ſecure, nor more licentious: but (if they amend not) to bring a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere and horrible reuenge vpon them. Let vs not therefore truſt to this, that God hath done it once, as though he would doe it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, though wee become negligent, and waxe worſe and worſe.</p>
            <p>Thus if we arme our ſelues, wee ſhall ſee
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18839:100"/>ſuch an ende of the battel, when the enemie ſhall come againſt vs, as God hath here fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed. <hi>The beaſt and the falſe prophet ſhall be taken, and caſt into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone:</hi> The reſt ſhall be ſlaine in ſuch number, that their bodies ſhall not bee buryed, but the rauens ſhall feede vpon their carcaſſes. Hitherto, God hath giuen victorie vpon victorie againſt <hi>the beaſt,</hi> and I truſt he will doe it ſtill, till that enemie be conſumed. This age hath ſeene manie victories againſt him, and it is verelie to bee thought, it ſhall ſee more. The triumphant ſongs ſet downe ſo oft in this Chapter, after the diſcouerie of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the beginning of his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe, make me greatlie to hope for it. Firſt the multitudes ſing: <hi>Halleluiah: Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and glorie, and honor, and power be to the Lorde our God. For hee hath condemned the whore, and reuenged the blood of his ſeruantes.</hi> And they ſayde againe: <hi>Halleluiah: and her ſmoake roſe vp for euermore. Then the paſtours, and all the creatures ſayde Amen, Halleluiah. And the fourth time, a voyce came out of the throne ſaying: Prayſe our God all yee his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and yee that feare him, both ſmall and great.</hi> And laſt of all: <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith: <hi>I heard lyke a voyce of a great multitude, and as the voyce of manie waters, and as the voice of ſtrong thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18839:101"/>ſaying, Halleluiah: for our Lorde God almightie hath reigned. Let vs be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and giue glory to him, for the mariage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her ſelfe readie.</hi> Thus about the time of the fall of this enemie, the ioye of the Church ſhall be vnſpeakeable: victorie followeth vpon victorie, triumph vpon triumph. God graunt that we may bee prepared againſt theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that (if they come againſt vs) we may yet haue experience of theſe victories, that wee may ſing theſe thankefull and ioyfull ſongs of deliuerance, and that wee may bee prepared to <hi>the mariage of the Lambe,</hi> and founde clothed with the <hi>wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment</hi> when hee commeth, Amen.</p>
